            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the meane ſpace, we cannot but highly extoll this rare modeſty in ſo great a Monarch; eſpecially when we heare <hi>M.

            </p>
            <p>Certainely, it is ſtrange, how any man could fall into a fit of ſuch extreme, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent madnes, were it not that God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſometymes ſuch exceſſe of malicious fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the reclayming of others miſled and ſeduced by theſe erring guids and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. In which reſpect I haue alway thought this Queſtion very profitable, and of great importance, to omit how neceſſary the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion thereof may proue ſooner then we are aware, in regard of the true, and great Antichriſt himſelfe; whoſe comming we haue far more reaſon to expect in our dayes, then the Ancient Fathers had in theirs.</p>
            <p>Thus the diuine Goodneſſe alway tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth euill into good, and maketh all things concurre to the welfare of his Elect; and by this ſtrang paradox and calumniation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteth and prepareth vs againſt Antichriſts comming, with an exact Diſcouery of his whole proceeding, and perſecution: which whoſoeuer conſidereth attentiuely, as it is layd downe in the ſacred Scripture, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the holy Fathers, will eaſily perceaue that hitherto the chiefeſt ſignes, and notes of Antichriſt haue not byn fulfilled by any. So

            <p>And in this alſo the matter may eaſily be decided; for who ſeeth not, that the falſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> draweth nigheſt vnto him both in name and deedes?

For which cauſe there haue not wanted ſome, both Catholicks, and <note place="margin">See Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Notwithſtanding this their errour, though neuer ſo groſſe, may ſeeme in ſome ſort excuſable becauſe they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne a certayne, and manifeſt enemy.</p>
            <p>But what shall we ſay of thoſe who take their marke ſo much amiſſe, that they make the chiefe viſible Paſtour of Chriſts Church a member of Sathan, yea Antichriſt himſelfe? Can any thing be more abſurd, or intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Is it poſſible, that any Chriſtian would giue <hi>Luther</hi> the hearing, when his proud
<pb facs="tcp:15294:4"/> ſpirit of contention, and contradiction made him firſt breake forth into this open blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? How did not Princes perceaue, that this was the high way to all rebellion? Could they conceaue or imagin, that Temporall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity &amp; Iuriſdiction would be regarded, where the chiefeſt ſpirituall power vpon earth was thus impudently contemned, and trodden vnder foot? Can they truſt to their Pedigrees, when they ſee the continuall ſucceſſion of 1500. yeares ſo lightly eſteemed? What bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Title can they pretend for themſelues, then the expreſſe words of our Sauiour, with which he eſtablished <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors?</p>
            <p>Your Maieſty wiſely obſerued, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <note place="margin">In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at Hampton court.</note> the Authority of Bishops were mayntai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that of Princes could not ſtand: <hi>No Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, no King,</hi> ſaith your Maieſty. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that no lawfull Bishop can be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden againſt the Popes Authority, to which all other ſpirituall Iuriſdiction is ſubordinate. Can any Iudge or Magiſtrate of the Realme be independant of your Maieſty? This is ſo euident, that euen the Puritans themſelues, though otherwiſe neuer ſo blinded with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt the Pope, could not chooſe but ſee
<pb facs="tcp:15294:5"/> it. For which cauſe they ſtick not to <hi>proteſt to all the world, that if the Prelats haue the Truth</hi> (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in this point) <hi>the Pope and the Church of Rome (and in them God, and Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe) haue great wrong and indignity offered vnto them, in</hi>

               <hi>that they are reiected, and that all the Proteſtant Churches are Schiſmaticall in forſaking vnity, and communion with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then it plainely appeareth that the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> neither according to the Truth it ſelfe, nor in the <hi>Puritans</hi> iudgment, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues, &amp; their pretended Bishops, but by eſtablishing the Pope, and <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And all the vehemency which they vſe againſt the Pope to proue him Antichriſt, falleth vpon themſelues, who participate with him in admitting the Hierarchy of Bishops. And as for other proofes proper to <hi>Puritans,</hi> they are inforced to anſwere them as well as we; yea moſt of all theſe Arguments be ſuch; as might very eaſily be turned againſt any lawfull Prince whatſoeuer; and much more againſt ſuch Proteſtant Princes, as beſides their Temporall power make clayme to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Iuriſdiction. Let any diſcreet Reader re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect vpon all particulers, and he will eaſily diſcerne, that if Catholicks had byn no more
<pb facs="tcp:15294:5"/> moderate then <hi>Luther</hi> and other Proteſtants were, King <hi>Henry</hi> could not haue intitled himſelfe <hi>Head of the Church in ſpirituall, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall affayres,</hi> without hauing the name of Antichriſt applyed, and appropriated vnto him. For if ſuch contumelious inferences be made againſt the Pope in great part, becauſe he is ſuppoſed (though falſly) to arrogate more to himſelfe in Temporall affayres, then of right he ought; how much more would the ſame imputation fall vpon ſuch a Prince, as did firſt vſurp ſpirituall Iuriſdiction, without eyther example or other probable pretenſe?</p>
            <p>But I will not vrge theſe odious inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces any further: your Maieſty will eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue how far this proiect might be purſued. And by peruſing this ſmall labour of myne, which I now offer to your Maieſty, it will manifeſtly appeare, that we haue euident, and inuincible Arguments taken out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and all Antiquity, to free our chiefeſt Paſtour, the Popes Holynes, from this moſt abſurd and falſe calumniation: and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer any Proteſtant can anſwere to theſe our proofes, is without any difficulty ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and confuted. As likewiſe their ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling inuectiues, and friuolous obiections are
<pb facs="tcp:15294:6"/> preſently diſſolued, &amp; returned vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. All which conſidered, I account it no preſumption to be an humble Suppliant to your moſt Excellent Maieſty for ſome releaſe and mitigation in the preſſures, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which Catholicks endure, vnder this pretence of the Popes being Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>For how can it poſſibly ſtand with iuſtice or reaſon, that a lawfull Prince should punish his loyall ſubiects for performing their duty to their ſpirituall and lawfull Paſtour? That Rebells should vphold Hereticks, who are Traytors againſt God and his Church, it were no meruaile, ſince they all agree in the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation of ſuperiour powers. And yet it is too notorious to the world, what Catholicks ſuffer for their conſcience in your Maieſtyes Dominions? what loſſe of lyuings, &amp; liberty, yea ſometyme of life it ſelfe? How buſy are Purſeuants in ranſacking their houſes, abuſing their ſeruants, and apprehending their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? What inſolencyes and vexations are they conſtrayned to endure?

            <head>THE PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O ſome I doubt not, this my labour, which I haue taken in diſcuſsing this queſtion of Antichriſt, will ſeeme ſuperfluous, or at leaſt not ſo well beſtowed, as it might haue bene in many other ſubiects. And they will be much confirmed in this their opinion, if they conſider, that among ſo many learned men, as haue written in our language, and euidently confuted the hereſies of our tymes; none of them haue vouchſafed to yield ſo far to our Aduerſaries, as to handle this queſtion of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which doubtles they omitted not without great conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and weighty reaſons: the chiefeſt of which, if I be not deceaued, was for that they perswaded themſelues, that few or none, eſpeciallie of the prudent and moderate ſort, did indeed, and in their hart hold this abſurd paradox, though they were content to let it paſſe, becauſe it ſerued for a motiue to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the common people from the Catholike faith, which in their conceipt conteyned other errors.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:15294:8"/>
            <p> And for this cauſe thoſe worthy and zealous writers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauored chiefly to take away this falſe perſwaſion of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches erring, partly by confirming and demonſtrating the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of her authority, and partly by deſcending to particuler controuerſies, and moſt euidently conuincyng the Churches do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in euery one of them to be conformable to the diuine Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and all antiquity. For they did eaſily diſcouer, that by this courſe they ſhould not only confute this abhominable b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy; but alſo with one and the ſame labour confirme and eſtabliſh the contrary truth: <hi>viz.</hi> that the Catholike Church, togeather with her ſupreme Paſtour, is the piller of Truth and the building of Chriſt, againſt which no force of errors or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies either hath or euer ſhall be able to preuayle.</p>
            <p>Which courſe of theirs as moſt prudent in it ſelfe, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe moſt profitable to others, I am far from myſliking, but doe altogeather approue and admyre it. And yet notwithſtanding, I hope, that this my labour may be in ſome ſort profitable alſo. For all are not ſo quick wytted, as to make theſe neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, but rather many are with-held from yielding to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt truth in other pointes by a preiudicate opinion, which they haue conceaued in this; and the iuſt and diſcreet ſilence, which hath hitherto bene vſed, miniſtreth to them ſome cauſe of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, that the Protestants haue reaſon for that they ſay; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince they vrge this point ſo much both in their Writings and Sermons, and the matter is of ſo great importance and conſequence, that whoſoeuer hath the truth on his ſyde in this, ought iuſtly to be belieued in the reſt, ſince that Antichriſt can neither agree with Chriſt, nor ſo great a calumniation as this is of the Pope (if it be falſe) can agree or ſtand with the ſpirit of truth. Beſides, the Proteſtants out of this their doctrine make moſt odious inferences againſt Catholikes, as to go no further, we may ſee in <hi>M. Downams</hi> laſt Chapter, where he deduceth out of it ſix concluſions.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:15294:8"/>
            <p> Firſt, <hi>that out of this all other controuerſies may be decided;</hi> and that the doctrine of the Catholike Church is to be reiected, as <hi>the errors of Antichriſt.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that their ſeparation from vs, is warranted, yea commaunded by the word of God, and all returning forbidden.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that all they which partake with vs, are reprobates, and to be damned.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>that the Recuſant Papiſts, but eſpecialy Ieſuites and Seminary Prieſts ought not to be fauoured or ſpared in a Chriſtian Common wealth.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>that there can be no reconciliation betwixt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and the Church of Rome</hi> Sixtly, <hi>that Proteſtants ought to be thankefull to God, who hath not ſuffered them to be carried away with this Catholike Apoſtaſy.</hi> By which laſt wordes we may alſo note, that if this their poſition of the Pope being Antichriſt doth fall, they haue no colour left to accuſe the Catholike Church of ſchiſme or hereſy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it remayneth euident, that ſhe is the true Church of Chriſt. For no ſchiſme or hereſy can be Catholike or vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is; only the perſecution and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy of Antichriſt may in ſome ſort vſurpe this name; becauſe, though it ſhall want the vniuerſality of tyme, being to remayne but a very ſhort tyme, yet it ſhalbe very vniuerſall in reſpect of place, as is manifeſt by that, which is ſaid in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Thus much ſhall ſuffice of the importance and neceſsity of this my ſmall labour. And now I will briefely ſay ſome thing of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whome I defend, and of <hi>M. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> whome I confute. And concerning this renowned and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt learned Cardinall, I ſhall not need to vſe many wordes, his fame being ſpred ouer the whole world by his large, and profound diſputations against all ſortes of hereticks which haue riſen or are extant in theſe our dayes. Wherefore it ſhalbe ſufficient to note, that which maketh to our purpoſe, that in this his Treatiſe of Antichriſt he vſeth not ſo many arguments as ſome others
<pb facs="tcp:15294:9"/> haue don; only contenting himſelfe with thoſe which are proper and peculiar to this place; omitting others, which do rather proue, that the Pope is the chiefe Paſtour of Chriſtes Church then diſprooue that he is not Antichriſt, which in him procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from two cauſes: the one is, his exactnes in the method, and diuiſion of his diſputations, which conteyne euery one ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall queſtions and arguments: the other, for that hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficiently diſcuſſed the affirmatiue poſition that the Pope is, and ought to be acknowledged to be the chiefe Paſtour of Gods Church, he would not make any needeles repetition of thoſe demonſtrations, but rather proceed to other which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he had not touched, and which directly concluded, that the Pope, not only by reaſon of his office, but alſo in reſpect of his perſon can in no ſort be that Antichriſt, which the Scriptures and Fathers affirme, that we are to expect towards the end of the world. I ſhall not need to adde any more in commendation of this his worke for that the whole Treatiſe following hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubiect, &amp; I haue tranſlated his whole Booke <hi>verbatim,</hi> ſo that the Reader may peruſe it, and iudge of it himſelfe. It were ſuperfluous to giue any reaſon, why in my allegations of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Cardinall, I only mention his name for the moſt part: for any man may eaſily perceaue, that I do it for breuities ſake, and according to the vſe of Schooles, and not for any want of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to his place and perſon, whome I honour from my hart, and defend him in this Treatiſe, ſo far, as my poore ability will giue me leaue.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>M. Downam</hi> (for ſo I commonly call him, to giue him to underſtand, that I impugne not his perſon, but his deteſtable hereſy) I ſhall haue ſomething more to ſay: for firſt the Reader muſt not be ignorant that he hath peruerted the order of this diſputation. For, whereas <hi>Cardinall Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> firſt demonſtrateth, that the Pope is not Antichriſt, and afterward anſwereth the obiections of his Aduerſaryes, <hi>M.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15294:9"/> 
               <hi>Downam</hi> tooke it to be his beſt courſe, first to obiect whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer either former heretikes had inuented, or he himſelfe could adde, omitting altogeather the anſwers, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> gaue; that by this meanes, he might poſſeſſe his Readers mynd by inueighing againſt the Pope at his pleaſure, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: and ſo haue him the more fauourable when he came to make ſhew of anſwering to <hi>Bellarmins</hi> arguments.</p>
            <p>This is the cauſe, why I am conſtrayned to confute <hi>M. Downams</hi> ſecond booke in the first place; not producing the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts without his ſolutions, as he dealt with the Cardinall, but examining whatſoeuer he anſwereth distinctly; in ſo much, that, one Chapter excepted where his confuſion would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> it, in all the reſt, euery number of my confutation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to the ſame in him: ſo that if any man hath a deſire to confer, what both he and I ſay, he may eaſily do it, by reading firſt one ſection or number in him, &amp; then the ſame in me; which I would require of all ſuch as do any way doubt of my ſincere dealing, becauſe he findeth not <hi>M. Downams</hi> wordes <hi>verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi> alleaged; which could not be without great prolixity. But he that goeth thus far, ſhould alſo do well to read ſo much in Cardinall <hi>Bellarmime,</hi> as is diſcuſſed in euery ſeuerall number, which, that the Reader may conueniently doe, I haue alſo prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed numbers to the Cardinalls diſcourſe, and noted in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, where that, which is handled in euery ſeuerall place, may be found in him without difficulty.</p>
            <p>And by this meanes I hope the Reader may peruſe this my labour with clarity, and profit, and diſcouer <hi>M. Downams</hi> falſe dealing, aſwell in this point ſpecified, as in many other, which now it is no tyme to rehearſe, they beeing very neere as many as there be leaues in this whole Booke, and they may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be found, by either peruſing the marginall notes, or ſeeking in the table at the word <hi>Downam.</hi> And yet perhaps it will not be amyſſe to note one or two of them in this place, which eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="tcp:15294:10"/> diſcouer the badneſſe of <hi>M. Downams</hi> cauſe. For what can be more abſurd or hatefull to Chriſtian eares, then to heare the enemyes of Chriſt, and his Church, commended and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and his true Seruants and Doctors inſolently reiected and accuſed of errours? And yet this is <hi>M. Downams</hi> caſe, not once or twyce, but throughout the whole courſe of this diſputation: for he doth not only agree in ſubſtance with the <hi>Samoſatens,</hi> who are knowne heretikes, and condemned by his owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo ioyneth himſelfe <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> with that vile A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtata and capitall enemy of Chriſt <hi>Porphiry,</hi> not only againſt <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> who moſt earneſtly and learnedly confuteth him at large, but alſo againſt all other Eccleſiaſticall writers, yea euen the very Iewes themſelues, who in that point agree with the Chriſtians; but in another, where they are oppoſite to vs, there <hi>M. Downam</hi> ioyneth with them: ſo that it ſeemeth, that <hi>M. Downam</hi> and his fellow Proteſtants ſeeke of purpoſe, how they may oppoſe themſelues to Chriſt and his Church, yea that they eſteeme more of Gentilles and Iewes, then they do of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian writers, though neuer ſo many, ſo worthy, or ſo ancient.</p>
            <p>And ſurely whoſoeuer ſhall conſider attentiuely, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and how ſcornefully the ancient Fathers and pillars of Chriſts Church, be reiected by <hi>M. Downam,</hi> cannot chooſe but admire, yea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hould vp his handes and bleſſe himſelfe, to thinke, how it hath byn, and is ſtill poſsible, that either they themſelues, or others by them ſhould be ſo bewitched. Neither can there any probable cauſe be giuen of ſo great blindnes, and ſo enormous a cryme, but only the want of Gods grace, which their ſinnes haue with drawne, and deſerued, that they ſhould be in this ſort as it were giuen ouer to a reprobate ſenſe. What can be ſaid in defence of this deteſtable exceſſe? Deny it they cannot, the thing being ſo euident, and ſo often reiterated. And dare they excuſe it, by telling vs, That the Fathers are only forſaken, when they forſake the Scripture? Is not this
<pb facs="tcp:15294:10"/> plainely to make Infidells and Heretikes better Interpreters of Scripture then the Church of Chriſt, and all Chriſtians in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and the moſt learned Paſtours thereof in particuler? If they anſwer, that it is not the authority of theſe Infidells, which they follow, but the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, which they experience in themſelues; is this any thing els in effect, then to acknowledge that <hi>Porphiry,</hi> and the <hi>Iewes</hi> had the true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, and that the ancient Fathers, and the Church of Chriſt in their tyme had it not? For if the Proteſtants, haue the ſpirit of Chriſt now, it is manifeſt, that thoſe others had it then, ſince their expoſitions be all one. But who is ſo fooliſh and ſacrilegious, as to depriue Gods Church and Saintes of his ſpirit, and it tribute it to his profeſſed enemyes, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how ſhall we belieue the Proteſtants, when they tell vs that they are full of Gods Spirit, ſince we ſee their ſpirit to agree with that of the Diuells inſtruments, and to be quite oppoſite to that of Gods elect? Heere is no ſtarting hole to be found, neither haue they any thing to reply, but only to ſtand vpon their bare affirmation; which <hi>M. Downam</hi> doth ſo often in his diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtill deſiring to haue that graunted which is chiefly in queſtion. But I will omit this, and the reſt of his abſurdities, remitting the Reader to his owne experience, after that he hath with diligence peruſed the whole.</p>
            <p>Heere I would make an end of this Preface, hauing ſaid aſmuch, as I thinke neceſſary concerning the diſputation, which followeth. But becauſe I haue lately ſeene two Sermons not long ſince preached by this our Doctour, by which it ſeemeth, that he hath reſolued to relinquiſh Puritaniſme and turne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, I thought it good to admoniſh my Reader of this point alſo; becauſe I rather inclined before to thinke, that he was a Puritan, and inſinuated ſo much in a place or two. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <note place="margin">Chap. 10. &amp; 13.</note> by this occaſion, I must intreat my Reader to marke the great difference betwixt <hi>M. Downam</hi> in theſe his Sermons,
<pb facs="tcp:15294:11"/> and the ſame man in his booke of Antichriſt: for in this he euery where reiecteth all antiquity, as I haue ſaid, but in his Sermons he ſingeth vs a new ſong, and can tell vs. <hi>that it neuer yet happened that the neweſt thinges did proue the trueſt,</hi> and argueth chiefely from authority, obiecting ſtill to his Puritan Aduerſaries, <hi>That they go againſt the whole ſtreame of all Antiquity,</hi> yea he can alleadge <hi>S. Auguſtine lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Bapt. con. Donat. cap.</hi> 24. <hi>&amp; ep.</hi> 118. to proue that the conſent of the whole Church argueth either the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Councell, or an Apoſtolicali Tradition, though he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptely tranſlateth <hi>(Traditum, Ordayned)</hi> and likewiſe in the ſecond place, where <hi>S. Aug.</hi> affirmeth that, <hi>Inſolentiſſimae inſaniae eſt,</hi> it is a moſt inſolent madnes to diſpute againſt that which <hi>(vniuerſa Eccleſia)</hi> the whole Church obſerueth; he addeth of his owne the word <hi>(Primitiue)</hi> that ſo he may haue ſome ſtareing hole againſt vs, when he is vrged with the ſame Authority of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which if he would follow himſelfe, as he would now haue the Puritans do, he muſt of force retyre himſelfe from the Proteſtants alſo, and betake himſelfe to the Catholike Church, which all Antiquity moſt manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth.</p>
            <p>And ſurely whoſoeuer conſidereth the arguments, which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> make againſt <hi>Puritans,</hi> cannot but euidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, that the very ſame principles do ouerthrow the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> themſelues. And I meruaile much, how they can defend themſelues from that terrible ſentence of <hi>S. Paul, Inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilises o homo omnis, qui iudicas: quo enim iudicas al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum, teipſum condemnas, eadem enim agis, quae iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas.</hi> And the very ſame iudgment falleth vpon the <hi>Puritans</hi> themſelues, when they go about to impugne the <hi>Browniſts, Familiſts, Anabaptiſts, Arians,</hi> or any other ſect whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer. For this they cannot do, but by Antiquity, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they are forced to reiect in all thoſe pointes, in
<pb facs="tcp:15294:11"/> which they differ, and diſſent from the Cathelike Roman Church.</p>
            <p>I will not deſcend to any particulers, though I eaſily might; for what can be more euident, then that the autherity of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> &amp; other Fathers, who vrge the neceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity of a Bishop, for the conſeruation of vnity, is much more to be vnderſtood of one chiefe Biſhop in the whole Church, then of particuler Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in particuler Dioceſſes, ſince there can be no queſtion, that vnity is as neceſſary in the whole world, as in one Dioceſſe, and much more eaſily mayntained in this, then in that? Likewiſe <hi>M. Downam</hi> can tell vs not only of Biſhops, but alſo of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans</hi> and <hi>Patriarches,</hi> and alleadgeth for his purpoſe the Councell of <hi>Nice;</hi> but he will not acknowledge that in the ſame Councell, <hi>Rome</hi> hath the firſt place, and is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all others, as likewiſe <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antiochia</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> (which <hi>M. Downam</hi> would willingly haue the chiefe) of which there can be no other true reaſon giuen, but the excellency of <hi>S. Peter</hi> aboue the other Apoſtles, who foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded three Churches, and placed or fixed his Sea in <hi>Rome,</hi> where he ended his life with a moſt happy Martyrdome. Now if we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But I intreat both him, and all other, euen as they tender their owne ſaluation, to looke about them in tyme, and not to ſuffer themſelues to be carried away with the ſway of the tyme, and the deſire of worldly pleaſures and preferments, which <hi>M.

Downam</hi> ſeemeth to wiſh, and to miſlike that law not a little, which (in a parentheſis) he telleth vs hath otherwiſe prouided.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the baſe and carnall cogitations of theſe new Ghoſpellers; and yet all will not ſerue: for they ſhall neuer find a remedy for this their griefe except they returne to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, whom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But in it God hath prouided for this, &amp; all other inconueniences, that can any way ariſe: and in particuler for the deciding of all queſtions and controuerſies. Wherefore if the Proteſtants and Puritans will haue an end of this of their Biſhops and Presbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they muſt of neceſsity ſtand to the Catholike Churches iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which they ſhall find Biſhops eſtabliſhed, and yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, by reaſon of perſecution, Prieſtes only without Biſhops, as now we ſee in our Country, where conformable to that which in their iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was practiſed in the Primitiue Church in many places, at leaſt for a tyme, we haue hitherto only Prieſtes ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to an Arch-Prieſt; but yet we are far from miſliking Biſhops, but do both wiſh, and expect them, when our lawfull Superiour, who ſucceedeth the chiefeſt of the Apoſtles, ſhall ſee it conuenient.</p>

                  <q>VVherfore that this queſtion may be diligentlie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> nine heads are to be treated of. Firſt of the name it ſelfe of Antichriſt. 2. VVhether Antichriſt be one man or a kind of men. 3. Of the tyme of his comming and death. 4. Of his proper name. 5. Of what nation he ſhalbe borne, &amp; by whome he ſhall chiefly be receaued. 6. Where he ſhall fixe his ſeate. 7. Of his doctrine and manners. 8. Of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. 9. Of his kingdome and warres. For out of all theſe, it will moſt cleerely appeare, with what impudencie the heretikes make the Pope Antichriſt: to which we will adde a Chapter, wherin we will proue, that the Pope is not onlie not Antichriſt, but that hee hath in no ſort left to be the Biſhop and paſtour of the whole Church, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may remayne not ſolued of <hi>Caluins</hi> obiections.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>For the firſt, ſome of our aduerſaries teach, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> name of Antichriſt doth properlie ſignifie the Vicar of Chriſt, and therefore that the Pope, who affirmeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be Chriſts Vicar is Antichriſt. So teacheth <hi>VVolfga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gus Muſculus in locis cap. de poteſt. Miniſtroru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and he proueth it, becauſe that word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> ſignifieth <hi>vice,</hi> whence <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> ſignifieth him who obtrudeth himſelfe for Captaine, that is, who will be accompted the Captaynes Vicar. The <hi>Magdeburgenſes cent.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>colum.</hi> 435. do teach, that the Pope is therefore the true Antichriſt becauſe he maketh himſelfe the vicar of Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But without doubt they are deceaued, or endeauour to deceaue, for the name of Antichriſt cannot in any ſort, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> ſignifie the Vicar of Chriſt, but only ſome that is contrary to Chriſt: and contrarie not howſoeuer, but in ſuch ſort, that he ſtriueth with him for the ſeate &amp; dignity of Chriſt, that is, who is <hi>aemulus Chriſti,</hi> at emulation with Chriſt, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15294:15"/> would be accounted Chriſt, hauing caſt him downe who is truly Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That this is the ſignification of this name, it is proued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> three waies. Firſt becauſe among the <hi>Grecians</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth properlie ſignifie <hi>oppoſition,</hi> and becauſe not onlie thoſe things are ſaid to be oppoſed, which are repugnant one to the other, but alſo thoſe, which are of equall value, from thence it proceedeth, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in compoſition, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme ſignifieth <hi>contrarietie,</hi> ſometyme <hi>equiualence,</hi> as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the examples of all ſuch names, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifieth an <hi>emulous</hi> in a combate, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary remedie, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie ſpeach, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> equiualent, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the thumme, becauſe it is oppoſed againſt, and is equiualent to all the reſt of the hand, and ſo of the reſt. But a Vicar doth not ſignifie oppoſition, but ſubordination to another, and therefore it cannot be expreſſed by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth not ſignifie the Captaines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> Vicar, but ordinarily a contrarie Captaine, as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is to make warre, and ſometime him that is in the Captai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes place, not as ſubiect to him, but as equall, as among the <hi>Latins, Propraetor</hi> or <hi>Proconſul</hi> doth not ſignifie the Vicar of the Pretor or Conſul, but him that is in ſome Prouince, that which the Pretor or Conſul is in the Citty: and in this <hi>Muſculus</hi> was deceaued; for becauſe he read in <hi>Budaeus</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth ſignifie a <hi>Propretor,</hi> he thought that it doth ſignifie the Vicar of the Pretor, which is falſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly the ſame is proued out of the Scripture: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> this name were of it ſelfe ambiguous, yet as it is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Scripture it is not doubtfull: and our queſtion muſt not be of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> abſolutelie, but as it is taken in the Scriptures. Now in the Scriptures, Antichriſt is ſaid to be him who is extolled aboue all that is called God, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. which certainelie is not to be the Vicar, but the enemy of Chriſt. And 1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 2. Antichriſt is ſayd to be him, who denieth <hi>Ieſus to be Chriſt, that he may ſell himſelfe for Chriſt.</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. Antichriſt is ſaid to affirme himſelfe to be Chriſt, which certainily is not the part of a Vicar, but of an Emulous.</q>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:15294:15"/>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly out of all the Authors, who haue written of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> Antichriſt, and out of the common ſenſe of all Chriſtians, who by Antichriſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a certaine notable falſe Chriſt. In which ſort expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth alſo this word of the ancient Greeks <hi>S. Damaſcen lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de fide cap.</hi> 28. and after the ſame manner doth <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Laſtlie ſo alſo expoundeth it in his <hi>Theſaurus lingnae Graecae</hi>

                     <hi>Henricus Stephaenus,</hi> who withſtanding is one of the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes of <hi>Geneua.</hi> Hence we haue our firſt argument againſt our aduerſaries. For ſince the name of Antichriſt ſignifieth the enemy and emulous of Chriſt, and the Pope confeſſeth himſelf to be Chriſts ſeruant, and ſubiect to Chriſt in all thinges, and in no ſort ſaith, that he is Chriſt, nor maketh himſelf equall to him, it is manifeſt, that he is not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</q>

And therfore it behooueth M. <hi>Downam</hi> and his fellows to haue as great a will to cleere themſelues in this behalfe, as it doth vs, and ſo much the more alſo, becauſe we are but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, and they are the ſlanderous calumniators; &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for that ſome of their owne brethren do much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne their inſolencie and raſh bouldnes in this aſſertion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now wheras he affirmeth, <hi>that the conceipts of the elder Papiſts who liued in the dares of our forefathers, concerning Antichriſt, were meere dotages,</hi> he only ſayth it, and therby diſcouereth his ſpitefull ſpirit, which prouoketh him to rayle without reaſon, and to ſlander againſt all truth. For the Catholikes of former dayes, held the very ſame, that we do now, though <note place="margin">Bellarmin agreeth with the elder Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes.</note> they explicated not themſelues ſo fully, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do now. In which reſpect only theſe may in ſome ſort be truly called <hi>the refiners of Popery,</hi> that is, the explicators and confirmers of Catholike doctrine againſt heretikes. But the reaſon of this difference betwixt the elder and later writers is euident, for in their dayes Heretikes were not ſo impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as to vrge ſo palpable and groſſe errors, as they are in our time: for otherwiſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſufficiently declareth the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of his doctrine, by prouing whatſoeuer he ſayth by the authority of the ancient Fathers. Now whether <hi>many haue contributed to Bellarmins bookes,</hi> or no, it is little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, though the truth is, as thoſe know that are beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his ſtudies, that they are all his owne labours. And that this may not ſeeme ſtrange, <hi>M. Downam</hi> may eaſily informe himſelfe, that diuers other of his order, that liued in the ſame time, and ſome in the ſame place, haue in diuers kindes written as large volumes, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath in this. Wherof <hi>Salmeron, Tolet, Valentia, Molina, Suarez, Vaſquez</hi> and others may ſerue for example. Well to come to the matter, <hi>M.

For who ſeeth not, that many things are like, which are not the ſame? or rather ſpeaking in rigour, that nothing is like, that is the ſame? And ſo likewiſe of equalitie, there be manie things like, which are not equall. As for example, the vnitie of Chriſts ſeruants among themſelues, is like to the vnion of Chriſt with his Father, but not the ſame, nor <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioan.</hi> 17.</note> equall vnto it. And in this our queſtion, who doubteth that the Vicar of Chriſt, as of any other, is like vnto him in honour, but yet he hath not in any ſort the ſame or equall honour to that which Chriſt hath; as not to explicate other differences, it is euident, that whoſoeuer is Vicar to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, acknowledgeth dependancie of another, which the principall doth not.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15294:20"/> corporallie. Secondly that Antichriſt ſhall not raigne more then three yeares and a halfe, and conſequently they teach, that Antichriſt ſhalbe only one man.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To the firſt argument of <hi>Beza</hi> I anſwere, that in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> Apoſtles tyme Antichriſt did begin ſecretly to giue onſetts, not in his owne perſon, but in his forerunners. For as Chriſt began to come from the beginning of the world, in the Patriarches and Prophets, who went before him, and did ſignifie him, ſoe that the myſterie of piety may be ſaid to haue begun to worke from the beginning of the world, and notwithſtanding he came not in his owne perſon, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he tooke fleſh of the B. Virgin: So Antichriſt ſtraight after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt into Heauen began to come in his forerunners, &amp; the myſterie of iniquitie began to work, to wit in the heretikes and I yrants which did perſecute the Church, and chieflie in <hi>Symon Magus,</hi> who called himſelfe Chriſt, and in <hi>Nero,</hi> who firſt began to impugne the Church; and yet notwithſtanding in his owne perſon he ſhall not come, but in the end of the world. Wherefore the ſpirituall perſecution of <hi>Symon Magus,</hi> and the temporall of <hi>Nero,</hi> is called the myſtery of iniquity, becauſe they were ſignes &amp; figures of Antichriſts perſecution.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That this is the true explication of the place of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> may be proued in two ſortes. Firſt by all the interpreters of that place: for all doe, by the myſtery of iniquity which <hi>S. Paul</hi> mentioneth, vnderſtand either <hi>Nero's</hi> perſecution, as <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> vpon this place, and <hi>S. Hierom quaeſt.</hi> 11. <hi>ad Algaſiam,</hi> or the Heretikes, who do deceaue ſecretly, as <hi>Theodoretus</hi> and <hi>Sedulius</hi> vpon this place, &amp; <hi>S. Auguſtine lib.</hi> 20. <hi>de ciuitate Dei cap.</hi> 19.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly by a reaſon taken from the aduerſaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> For they ſay, that Antichriſt properly is the ſeate
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15294:20"/> of the Biſhop of Rome. If therfore Antichriſt ſo properly called was borne in the Apoſtles tyme, it doth follow that <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul</hi> were properlie called Antichriſts, although ſecret, and that <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Symon Magus</hi> were the true Chriſt. For it is well knowne, that in the Apoſtles time, there were no other Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul.</hi> For <hi>Irenaeus lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. doth plainly affirme, that the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> was founded by <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and that they were the firſt Biſhops there, which all the auncient Fathers, which I cited before, doe alſo teſtifie. It is alſo well knowne that both <hi>Symon Magus</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend with <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> Wherfore if the Aduerſaries miſlike, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> were Antichriſts, and <hi>Symon</hi> &amp; <hi>Nero</hi> the true Chriſt, they are forced to confeſſe, that in the Apoſtles tyme Antichriſt was not come in himſelfe, but only in a certayne Type of his: by which meanes <hi>Beza's</hi> conſequence with which he concluded, that Antichriſt cannot be one man, vnles we could giue him one man who ſhould liue from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles tyme to the end of the world, is ſhewed to be ridiculous.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To confirme this I ſay, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth ſpeake in that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> manner, as our Lord ſpeaketh of <hi>Elias, Matth.</hi> 17. Elias <hi>indeed shall come, and reſtore all things, and I ſay vnto you, that</hi> Elias <hi>is already come, and they did not know him:</hi> that is, <hi>Elias</hi> in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall come, but <hi>Elias</hi> in his like is come already, to wit, in <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To the ſecond Argument. Firſt it is denied, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/> 
                     <hi>Daniel</hi> by particular beaſts, doth vnderſtand ſeuerall Kingdomes: for by one beaſt he doth ſometymes ſignify one Kingdome, as in the 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> where by the Lion he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the Kingdome of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> by the Beare the Kingdome of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> by the Leopard the Kingdome of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> by the other beaſt vnnamed the Kingdome of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Sometymes one King, as in the 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> where by the Ram he doth vnderſtand <hi>Darius</hi> the laſt King of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> by the Goate <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly I deny the conſequence of his argument: for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> 
                     <hi>S. Paul</hi> by the man of ſinne, doth not vnderſtand any of the foure beaſts deſcribed by <hi>Daniel,</hi> but he vnderſtandeth that little horne, which as <hi>Daniel</hi> writeth preuailed againſt the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15294:21"/> ten hornes of the fourth beaſt, that is, that one King, who from a little beginning did ſo increaſe, that he ſubdued all the other Kings vnto him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To the laſt Argument I anſwere many wayes, that it may be vnderſtood how impudently <hi>Caluin</hi> wrote, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/> they do wilfully erre, who do not gather out of that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is Antichriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Firſt by the Apoſtaſy in <hi>S. Paul,</hi> moſt rightly Antichriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/> himſelfe may be vnderſtood, for ſo with common conſent do the Greeke Interpreters teach, <hi>S. Chryſoſtome, Theodoretus, Theophilactus,</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> and beſides <hi>S. Auguſtine lib.</hi> 20. <hi>de ciuit. Dei cap.</hi> 19. and Antichriſt is called the Apoſtaſy, both by the figure called <hi>Metonymia,</hi> becauſe he ſhalbe the cauſe, that many forſake God: and alſo by a certaine excellency, for he ſhalbe ſuch a notable Apoſtata, that he may be called the Apoſtaſy it ſelfe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly by the Apoſtaſy, may be taken the defection, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/> or falling from the Roman Empire, as many of the <hi>Latins</hi> do expound, as <hi>S. Ambroſe, Sedulius,</hi> and <hi>Primaſius.</hi> For as in the Chapter following we will demonſtrate that Antichriſt ſhal not come, before the Roman Empire doth wholy periſh.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly if we admit, that by the Apoſtaſy is meant the defectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or failing from the true Faith &amp; religion of Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/> (as Caluin doth ſhew) we are not driuen into any ſtraits or difficulties. For it is not neceſſary, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the Apoſtaſie of many ages, for he might ſpeake of ſome very great and ſingular apoſtaſy, which ſhall only be in that very ſhort time, in which Antichriſt ſhall raigne, and ſo <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> in the place before cited, that is <hi>l.</hi> 20. <hi>de ciuit. Dei. cap.</hi> 19. writeth, that this place was vnderſtood of many Ancients, who probablie did teach, that Antichriſt appearing, all Heretikes or faygned Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſhould wholy come to him, &amp; by that meanes there would be at that tyme a very great Apoſtaſy, ſuch as neuer had bene before.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fourthly, if we graunt to <hi>Caluin,</hi> that <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of another Apoſtaſy of many ages, yet he ſhall get nothing. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIV"/> For we may ſay that, that Apoſtaſy doth not neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto one body &amp; Kingdome of Antichriſt, nor require one head, but that it is a diſpoſition to Antichriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15294:21"/> &amp; that it is made in diuers places, vnder diuers Kings, and vpon diuers occaſions, as now we ſee that <hi>Africa</hi> is fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or reuolted to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> a great part of <hi>Aſia</hi> to <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="5 letters">

                        </gap>hes,</hi> and other Prouinces to other Sects.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fiftly and laſtly, if we ſhould graunt to <hi>Caluin,</hi> that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXV"/> generall Apoſtaſy from the fayth, and which endureth now many yeares is Antichriſts Kingdome, it would not ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way follow, that the Pope is Antichriſt: for that queſtion were to be handled, who hath failed or reuolted from the Faith or Religion of Chriſt, we or they; that is, the <hi>Catholikes</hi> or the <hi>Lutherans?</hi> Though they ſay, that we are thoſe, which haue failed, notwithſtanding they haue not yet proued it, nor hath it bene declared by any common Iudge. And truly we can farre more eaſily prooue, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are thoſe, who haue failed, then they prooue, that the <hi>Catholikes</hi> haue failed. For that they haue failed from the Church, in which they were before, they themſelues do not deny. For to let paſſe the reſt, <hi>Eraſmus Sarcerius</hi> vpon that of the 2. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Then the wicked one shalbe reuealed,</hi> doth plainely confeſſe, that almoſt all the predeceſſors of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and he alſo did ſometimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Biſhop of Rome, therfore they haue fayled from the Church, and Religion of their predeceſſors. But that we haue failed from any Church, neither haue they demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hitherto, neither will they euer be able to demonſtrate. Wherfore when they read in <hi>S. Paul, Vnles the reuolt or Apoſtaſy be come, and the wicked one reuealed &amp;c.</hi> and thinke that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Church, in which they were, and that we do perſeuer alway in the ſame ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, it is meruaile, if at leaſt they do not feare, leaſt <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpake of them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Out of this ſecond head, we haue the ſecond argument, to prooue that the Pope is not Antichriſt. For if Antichriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVI"/> be only one perſon, and there haue bene and ſhall be many Popes, endued with the ſame dignity and power; certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Antichriſt is to be ſought els where, then in the Roman Sea.</q>

But you muſt giue one, that hath an ill cauſe in hand leaue to ſeeke to help himſelfe by all the trickes, and fetches he can inuent, for it was not without a further purpoſe, that <hi>M. Downam</hi> would needes haue <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proue, and not anſwere in this ſimilitude, if you conſider his wordes. <hi>In which ſimilitude</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is no proportion, vnleſſe that which is in queſtion be taken for graunted, namely that Antichriſt is but one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler perſon, as Chriſt is.</hi> So that there is proportion in it, if Antichriſt may be ſaid to be a particuler perſon, which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be alwaies lawful for <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or any other defendant to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, till his Aduerſary driue him from that aſſertion by ſome forcible argument, and likewiſe to explicate in what ſenſe he ſaith ſo, by ſome example, which his Aduerſaries themſelues cannot deny. Wherfore <hi>M.

After this, he maketh an idle obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his owne, &amp; anſwereth it as ſleightly, both which I leaue alſo to himſelfe to conſider.

                  <p n="11">11. To the firſt proofe of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> anſwere, he reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> the former interpretation of thoſe 3. Fathers <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi>

                     <hi>S. Chryſoſtome,</hi> and <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> by his owne abſolute authority. For when he began to thinke how he might deceaue ſome of the ſimple ſort, by making a ſhew that the Pope is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, he did put this downe for a chiefe Principle, that Antichriſt ſhould be no open, but a diſguiſed enemy, and a pretended Chriſtian: and this he wil defend againſt all the Fathers, yea againſt the Apoſtles, &amp; Chriſt himſelfe, though with this difference, that againſt the Fathers, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, were the members of Chriſt, he oppoſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe manifeſtlie: but againſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles onlie couertlie, by falſe expoſitions of his owne head, with which he conuinceth, that he is only a member of that great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and not the great Antichriſt himſelfe. But I hope well, that both <hi>M. Downam</hi> himſelfe and all that follow him, or ioyne with him againſt thoſe ancient Fathers the true members of Chriſt, will at length ioyne with them againſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15294:28"/> thoſe diſguiſed enemies and pretended Chriſtians, of which number, they themſelues are for the preſent. And in the meane tyme, till they amend themſelues, they muſt giue vs leaue to thinke with the holy Fathers, that both Antichriſts members, as alſo himſelfe haue bene, and ſhalbe not only diſguiſed, but alſo open enemies of Chriſt, as you ſee thoſe holy Fathers affirme of Nero and the other of the Heretikes, who deceaue ſecretly, which both <hi>M.

And yet we may note, that this ſecrecy of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes is not ſo great, but that many times it contayneth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt oppoſition againſt Chriſt, as we ſee in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who named himſelfe Chriſt, and in <hi>Montanus</hi> who would needes be the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And if <hi>M.

Downam</hi> to be ſo cunning both in Scripture and Hebrew, that he will not contradict it for that he was not paſt 20. yeares ould when he began his Monarchie by his admirable victories, for which in the 5 verſe he is ſaid, <hi>to haue gone ſo ſwiftly, as though he had ſlowen in the ayre, and not touched the earth.</hi> By which meanes, the litle horne which he had betwixt his eyes, that is the Kingdome which he gouerned, came to be very great &amp; ſtrong in a ſhort ſpace &amp; at his death was deuided into foure little ones, in reſpect of his great Monarchie, which contayned all thoſe 4.

                     <hi>Bezas</hi> conſequence was nothing worth: and poore <hi>M.

And yet to ſet the better face on it, he denieth alſo <hi>that Antichriſt is the little horne,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmeth. But he ſhould haue conſidered that the other was that which was neceſſary, that the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t might ſtand in force, and that now <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is the defendant, and therfore it is not inough for <hi>M.

                  <p n="15">15. About the third obiection <hi>M.

                     <hi>ſignifieth the whole body and Kingdome of Antichriſt.</hi> In which <note place="margin">Downam miſtaketh Bellarmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> reply of his, I can ſee no other reaſon but want of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath ſaid: for the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is giuen by him in his firſt anſwere of the word <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> is onely this, <hi>that Antichriſt is called the Apoſtaſie, for that he shalbe the cauſe that many forſake God:</hi> ſo that not thoſe which forſake God, but he that is the cauſe therof, is called the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie.</hi> And ſo though thoſe that forſake God be many, yet he that is the cauſe may be only one. If <hi>M. Downam</hi> hath any thing to reply againſt this, eyther he muſt ſhew, that the cauſe of the <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> may not be called the <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> or elſe, that one man may not be the cauſe that many forſake God, and not ſpeake ſo confuſedly and darkly as he doth, leaſt he make <note place="margin">Downam ſpeaketh from the purpoſe.</note> men thinke that he vſeth that art, to ſeeme to ſay ſomthing, when he hath nothing to ſay indeed, which may be alſo ſuſpected, by that which he addeth out of <hi>S.

About the ſecond reaſon, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> giueth, why Antichriſt may be called the <hi>Apoſtaſy, M. Downam</hi> hath nothing to ſay againſt it, but <note place="margin">Antichriſt ſhalbe an Apoſtata.</note> only noteth, that ſeeing none can be an Apoſtata which hath not bene a Chriſtian, Antichriſt ſhal not be a Iew, but a back ſliding and reuolted Chriſtian: which if we take the name properly, as it ſignifieth one that falleth from Chriſt, is a probable argument, that Antichriſt ſhalbe baptized: but yet he may be a Iew, both by birth, as alſo by profeſſion, as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> was a Gentile in profeſſion, and yet a notable <hi>Apoſtata.</hi> But this name may alſo be vnderſtood of thoſe which fall from God, though they were no Chriſtians. And in this ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe it is more ample, and therfore more fit for Antichriſt, who ſhall not only oppoſe himſelfe to Chriſt, but alſo extoll him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aboue all that is called God. And this is all, that <hi>M. Downam</hi> replyeth to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> firſt anſwere, for he hath not ſoe much as gone about to proue, that Antichriſt may not be vnderſtood by the <hi>Apoſtaſy,</hi> becauſe he ſhalbe the cauſe that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15294:31"/> many forſake God, or becauſe he ſhalbe a moſt notable <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtata;</hi> nor that one man may not be called ſoe for theſe two reaſons, which be only the points that could make againſt <hi>Bellarmines</hi> anſwere.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. To the ſecond anſwere <hi>M. Downam</hi> replieth firſt, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie may be probablie defended, which is inough for to ſolue the argument, eſpecially ſince it cannot be denied, but that the word may haue this ſignification; and S. <hi>Pauls</hi> drift and context doth fauour this explication, for that he giueth reaſons, why the comming of Chriſt was not to be thought ſo neere at hand, as ſome gaue out: which he doth more fullie, if we vnderſtand it after this manner, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince, as concerning Antichriſt, he ſpeaketh plainely inough after.

Downam</hi> doth alſo thinke, that he had not all perfect knowledge, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer from the beginning, which I will not charge him with all, vntill I heare him ſay ſo, for that I haue a better opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him, then that he will fall into ſo great folly or blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Wherfore I doubt not, but that he will eaſily ſee, that our Sauiour taught and wrought according to that which was ſet downe by the heauenly wiſdome of his Eternall Father, who gaue to the Iewes ſuch outward meanes, as were very ſufficient in that kind to haue drawne them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg and receaue their true <hi>Meſsias;</hi> but yet no doubt, could haue taught them more plainly, and not in Parables, as our Bleſſed Sauiour ſaid, and did alſo to his Apoſtles, and likewiſe could haue wrought greater miracles, as well as the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors, but he wrought thoſe which were determyned to be wrought in that tyme, and which were foretould in the Scriptures, &amp; denied flatly to work ſome other, as to giue them ſignes from Heauen, and to come downe from the Croſſe. But beſides theſe outward meanes, he vſed other inward, which are far more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and therfore I meruaile much, that <hi>M. Downam</hi> forgot them, for I will not ſuſpect, that he was either ſo ignorant as not to know them, or ſo addicted to <hi>Pelagius</hi> as to deny them: and yet in theſe alſo he vſed ſuch moderation as on the one ſide, the Iewes had no want of them, if they would not haue bene wanting themſelues, and yet our Sauiour could haue giuen them far greater inward helpes then he did. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt <hi>M. Downam</hi> vrge his diſtinction too far of <hi>Chriſt as Man;</hi> for either it will prooue too much, or nothing at all. For if he ſpeake of the humanitie of Chriſt, conſidered in it ſelfe, and not as the inſtrument of his Diuinitie, then he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15294:33"/> could not doe any miracle at all of thoſe which he actuallie did; and therefore I alway ſuppoſe, that <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſpeaketh not in this baſe and vnworthy ſenſe, by which Chriſt is conſidered, not only as man, but alſo as if he were no more, nor no better then a pure man; but if it be conſidered, as the inſtrument of his Diuinity, then his power extendeth it ſelfe ſo farre, as the power of God himſelfe, though actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he putteth not all in execution, but only that which Gods eternall wiſdome hath appointed. But now to <hi>M. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nams</hi> reply, I graunt the Antecedent, but deny the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, cheifly, for that we haue ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ground to think ſo, though we could not vnderſtand the reaſon of it: and beſides, that very obſtinacy of the Iewes doth giue a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of this euent. For if, being aſſailed by ſuch effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and wonderfull meanes: as the doctrine and miracles of Chriſt, his Apoſtles and Diſciples were, notwithſtanding it was forcible inough to keep them in their former ſynnes, and to draw them into farre greater; what meruaile is it, that being deſtitute of ſuch extraordinary helpes, and ſet v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon by Antichriſt and his followers, who ſhall abound with all power and deceitfull meanes, and ſuch eſpecially as they expect; that they yield vnto his doctrine, &amp; take him with one accord to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whom they haue ſo long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. And as for the reſt of the world that ſhall ioyne with him, it ſhall not come, eſpecially at the firſt, ſo much for the liking of his doctrine, as for deſire of liberty, coldenes of charity, and abounding in ſynne, which be the chaines by <note place="margin">How An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhall draw men to follow him.</note> which men are drawen into errours, hereſies, and infidelity, as both our Sauiour and <hi>S.

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>M.

After he ſaith that he hath <hi>shewed, that the whole body of Apoſtataes, and Heretikes profesſing the name of Chriſt, is Antichriſt,</hi> about which I remit the Reader to that, which hath bene anſwered to what he hath ſaid hitherto. Thirdly he anſwereth inſteed of replying, that <hi>all degrees going before the reuelation of Antichriſt, were a diſpoſition not to the being, but to the reuealing of Antichriſt:</hi> for (as <hi>S.

                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:15294:34"/> But to this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwered long ſince, that Antichriſt was not in the Apoſtles tyme in perſon, but only in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners; and the diſtinction of being, and reuealing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, euen in <hi>M.

And the like is of any thing, that is neceſſarylie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to ſome manifeſt token, by which it may be knowne, as heretikes and Apoſtataes are if they declare themſelues for ſuch by doctrine and workes, of which <hi>M.

But this maketh nothing to the purpoſe, for all that tyme they are not come in the ſight of men, but only in the ſight of God; and no man will deny, but that Antichriſt may come in this ſort before he begin to teach. But this is not the comming, which <hi>M.

After this, he citeth <hi>Theodoretus,</hi> who by Apoſtaſy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth Antichriſtes preſence. As though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had not admitted and anſwered that interpretation before. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie he noteth for a thing verie vnlikelie, that the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Antichriſt ſhould be 1500. yeares in making, &amp; that he ſhould continue o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly 3. yeares and a half.

                     <hi>are not ſo many perſons, but ſo many heades or States of gouerment, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the commonwealth of the Romans hath ben at diuers tymes gouerned: the ſixt head was the ſtate of Emperors: the</hi> 7. <hi>Antichriſt, as the Papiſts confeſſe</hi> (for which he citeth <hi>Rhem. in Apoc.</hi> 17. and <hi>Bellarmine:) the eight</hi> (which alſo is one of the 7.) <hi>the ſtate of the Emperours renewed.</hi> Wherby it euidently appeareth, not only that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is not one man, but alſo that the Pope (who is the 7. head) is Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwere, that all or the moſt part of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is falſe, and eſpeciallie that which appertayneth to the preſent purpoſe.

Downa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> doe expound it farre otherwiſe. Secondly, though we admit this expoſition as probable, and that the head is Antichriſt yet it followeth not, that he ſhalbe any more then one man, for he may haue a different gouernement, which is to endure
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15294:35"/> but only in his owne tyme, eſpecially ſince in the ſame place he is ſaid <hi>to ſtaie a short tyme,</hi> and els where it is plainly expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, that it ſhalbe only three yeares and a halfe; and ſo it appeareth not ſoe euidentlie, as <hi>M.

For neither is he the 7. head, ſince the 6. ſtill remayneth; neither hath he endured a ſhort tyme, as the 7, head ſhall. And as for the 8. which <hi>M.

                  <q>Firſt all auncient Writers, conſidering the malice of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> their tymes, ſuſpected that the tymes of Antichriſt were at hand.

               <p>
                  <q>This opinion cannot yet be refuted by experience, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> according to the true Chronologie or accompt of times, there are about fiue thouſand, and ſix hundreth yeares paſt ſince the world was made. Wherfore <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> who <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>in Luc. cap.</hi> 2. reiecteth this opinion, affirming that in his time there were 6. thouſand yeares paſt, is manyfeſtly deceaued. <hi>S.

Neither doth it follow from hence, that we doe know the tyme of the laſt daie, for we ſay that it is probable, that the world will not endure aboue 6. thouſand yeares, but we doe not ſay, that it is certaine. Wherfore <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuketh thoſe, who affirme that the world ſhalbe ended at ſome certaine tyme, ſince our Lord ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 1. that it doth not belong to vs to know the tymes and moments, which the Father hath put in his owne power. See <hi>S. Auguſtine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</hi> 80. <hi>ad Heſychium in Pſal.</hi> 89. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 18. <hi>de ciuitate Dei, cap.</hi> 53.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Wheras all the Heretikes of this tyme doe teach, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is Antichriſt, and that he hath appeared already, &amp; is now in the world: notwithſtanding they doe not agree among themſelues of the tyme when he appeared, for there be ſix opinions of theirs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The firſt is of the <hi>Samoſatenes,</hi> which liue in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> 
                     <hi>Tranſiluania,</hi> who in a certaine booke which they intitle, <hi>Forewarnings of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, of the abolishing the true Chriſt by Antichriſt,</hi> do teach, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> appeared a little after the Apoſtles time, to wit, when that doctrine began firſt to be preached, that Chriſt is the euerlaſting Sonne of God, for they thinke, that Chriſt is only man, and that in God there is only one perſon, and that this faith was preached by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles: but that a little after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles death, the Roman Antichriſt came, and hauing aboliſhed the true Chriſt, which was only man, brought in another eternall Chriſt, and made a threefould God, and a twofould Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This opinion beſides the arguments which afterward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> we will bring againſt all Heretikes, is moſt eaſilie refuted in two ſortes. Firſt, for that Antichriſt when he commeth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15294:37"/> ſhall make himſelfe God and not any other, as the Apoſtle ſaith 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. but the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they themſelues ſay hath not made himſelfe God, but preached Chriſt, and of only man hath made him God. Secondly becauſe they ſaie, that ſtraight after the death of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the true faith of Chriſt was wholy extinguiſhed by Antichriſt, and afterward in the whole world Chriſt was adored for God. But Chriſt foretould that <hi>the gates of hell should not preuaile againſt his Church, Matth.</hi> 16. and the Angell fortould, that <hi>Chriſts Kingdome should endure for euer, Luc.</hi> 1. and <hi>Dauid</hi> foretould, <hi>that all Kinges should ſerue Chriſt, Pſal.</hi> 71. how therefore is it true, that in the very beginning, the Church being yet but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borne, was deſtroyed by Antichriſt?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſecond opinion is of <hi>Illyricus,</hi> who in his Catalogue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> of witneſſes, teacheth that Antichriſt came, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire began to incline to deſtruction: but it is manifeſt that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire began to decline after the tenth yeare of <hi>Honorius,</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi> was firſt taken, that is, in the yeare foure hundreth and twelue, as <hi>Blondus</hi> doth ſhew in the firſt booke of the firſt Decade of Hiſtories, from the declination of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But <hi>Illyricus</hi> doth ſeeme to vnderſtand this of the conception, &amp; not of the natiuitie of Antichriſt for he himſelfe <hi>Cent.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. in the beginning ſaith, <hi>that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt was conceaued after a certaine manner, in the beginning of the</hi> 400. <hi>yeare, after quickned, formed, and nourished in his Mothers wombe about the fiue hundreth yeare, and laſtlie borne the</hi> 6. <hi>hundreth and ſixt yeare, to wit, when</hi> Phocas <hi>graunted to the B. of</hi> Rome, <hi>that he should be called the head of the whole Church.</hi> Againe <hi>cent.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi> 438. he affirmeth, that Antichriſt <hi>should reigne, &amp; tyranize with the ſpirituall ſword, a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore yeares, and with the temporall ſword</hi> 6. <hi>hundreth</hi> 3. <hi>ſcore, and</hi> 6. <hi>yeares, &amp; that then the end of the world should come.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>He gathereth the former number, out of <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> it is ſaid, that the tyme of Antichriſt ſhall endure <hi>a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore daies,</hi> for <hi>Illyricus</hi> will haue a daie taken for a yeare: he gathereth the latter number out of <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. where <hi>the number of the Beaſt,</hi> is ſaid to be 666.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This opinion may be refuted in two manners. For firſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> it followeth that Antichriſt is already not only borne, but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15294:38"/> alſo dead, and conſequently that the end of the world is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come. For the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop began to haue the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſword, that is, temporall dominion at leaſt, from the yeare 699. for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did <hi>Aripertus</hi> giue the <hi>Coſtian alpes,</hi> where <hi>Genua</hi> is now ſituated to the B. of <hi>Rome,</hi> and afterward in the yeare 714. <hi>Luitpr and</hi> confirmed that donation, as <hi>Ado Vienenſis</hi> writeth in the Chronicle of theſe yeares, <hi>Blondus l.</hi> 10. <hi>decad.</hi> 1. and the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> confeſſe the ſame <hi>cent.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>col.</hi> 685. and <hi>Theodor. Bibliander,</hi> who noteth that, <hi>in this yeare</hi> 714. <hi>the firſt Papiſticall Prouince was made.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Not long after, to wit in the yeare ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred fiftie &amp; fiue, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> 
                     <hi>Pipin</hi> gaue to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> the Exarchy of <hi>Reuenna</hi> with a great part of <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Rhegino, Ado, Sigebert, Blond. l.</hi> 12. <hi>decad.</hi> 1. <hi>Aemilius,</hi> and the <hi>Centuriators</hi> themſelues, <hi>cent.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>col.</hi> 724. and <hi>Theodor. Bibliander</hi> in his Cronicle doe witnes. If therefore the Kingdome of Antichriſt did begin in this 755. yeare, and endured 666. yeares, it ended in the yeare of Chriſt 1421. and ſo it is more then 150. yeares ſince Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt died: and if the beginning of his kingdome be taken higher vp, to wit in the yeare of our Lord 699. then the end is to be put in the yeare 1365. and there wilbe more then two hundred yeares paſt, ſince the death of Antichriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Perhappes, they will anſwere, that Antichriſt ſhall not dy after the 666. yeare of his temporall kingdome, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> ſhall only looſe his temporall command. For ſince they ſay that the ſpirituall kingdome of Antichriſt ſhall endure 1260. yeares, which ſhould not yet be ended, though they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun from the 606. of Chriſt; they muſt ſay conſequentlie, that the ſpirituall kingdome of Antichriſt ſhall indure for ſome ſpace, after that his temporall kingdome be deſtroyed. But verilie it is abſurd, and againſt all authors; and beſides at leaſt it followeth, that two hundred years paſt, the Popes ſhould haue loſt their temporall dominion, which is againſt experience.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly the ſame error may be refuted, for that it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> that the <hi>Centuriators</hi> doe know exactly, when the world ſhalbe ended, which notwithſtanding is againſt the wordes of our Lord, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. and that it doth follow, is manifeſt; for they know, that Antichriſt did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:15294:38"/> to reigne with the ſpirituall ſword the yeare 6. hundreth and 6. They know alſo, that he ſhall reigne only 1260. years and that ſtraight after our Lord will come to iudgment, as they themſelues gather out of <hi>S. Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they know, that the laſt Iudgment ſhalbe in the yeare of Chriſt 1866. or if they know not this, they muſt alſo of force be ignorant, whether Antichriſt be come or noe:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The third opinion is of <hi>Dauid Chytraeus,</hi> who in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> vpon <hi>Apoc.</hi> 9. doth hould with <hi>Illyricus,</hi> that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt appeared about the yeare of our Lord 600. &amp; he doth manifeſtly inough ſignify, that <hi>S. Gregory</hi> was the firſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pope. But vpon the 12. and 13. Chapters <hi>Chytraeus</hi> doth not agree with <hi>Illyricus</hi> about the tyme that Antichriſt ſhall indure, but doth wiſely admoniſh, that it is not raſhly to be defined; and he proueth with three reaſons, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt did appeare the 600. yeare.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Firſt, becauſe at that tyme <hi>Gregory</hi> eſtabliſhed the Inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> of Saintes, &amp; <hi>Maſſes</hi> for the dead. Secondly becauſe in the yeare 606. <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the third did obtaine of <hi>Phocas</hi> the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>vniuerſall Bishop.</hi> He addeth a third reaſon in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary vpon the 13. Chap. for that this tyme doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and euidently agree with the number of the name of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, which contayneth 666. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Chytraus</hi> addeth in the ſame place, that out of this ſame number of Antichriſts name, is gathered the tyme, in which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/> Antichriſtes Kingdome was confirmed by <hi>Pipin,</hi> for there be almoſt ſo many yeares from the 97. yeare, in which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> wrote his <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> vntill <hi>Pipin,</hi> to wit 666. And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the tyme is gathered, in which the Pope was firſt deſigned and declared Antichriſt by Iohn <hi>Huſſe.</hi> For there be almoſt 666. yeares from <hi>Pipin,</hi> to <hi>Iohn Huſſe.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This opinion may eaſily be refuted, for it is founded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> only in lies. For firſt <hi>S. Gregory</hi> was not the firſt, which taught to call vpon Saintes, and offer Maſſes for the dead. All other auncient writers taught the ſame, as we haue elswher demonſtrated. Now only <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> ſufficeth, who liued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>S. Gregory</hi> 200. yeares <hi>lib. de viduis. The Angels</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are to be earneſtly beſeeched, as alſo the Martyrs.</hi> &amp; <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ep.</hi> 1. ad <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinum de obitu ſororis. Therfore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I doe not thinke, that she is</hi>

                     <hi>ſo much to be bewayled, as to be holpen with prayers, nor to be mourned for with thy tears, but that her ſoule be commended to God with oblations.</hi> Neither did <hi>Phocas</hi> giue the title of <hi>Vniuerſall</hi> to the Pope, but called him the <hi>Head of the Churches.</hi> But long before, <hi>Iuſtinian ep. ad Ioannem</hi> 2. had done this ſame; and before that alſo the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon in ep. ad Leonem:</hi> without cauſe therfore is the comming of Antichriſt put in the tyme of <hi>Phocas.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now that which <hi>Chytraeus</hi> addeth of the number 666. is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/> fooliſh, becauſe that number doth not preciſelie agree with the times, in which <hi>Chytraeus</hi> would haue Antichriſt to haue appeared, or to haue byn confirmed or declared. For from Chriſt to <hi>Phocas</hi> his decree, there be 607. yeares, not 666. from the reuelation of the Apocalyps to <hi>Pipin,</hi> there be 658. yeares: from <hi>Pipin</hi> to <hi>Io. Huſſe</hi> there are, as he himſelfe ſaith 640. yeares. But <hi>S. Io.</hi> in the Apocalyps noted a preciſe number, ſince he addeth alſo the leaſt particles. Moreouer <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> declared not firſt the Pope to be Antichriſt: for <hi>VVickliſſ</hi> had done ſo before: yea <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> neuer ſaid, that the Pope was Antichriſt, for in the 19. article condemned at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> he ſaith, that Clergie men by their couetouſnes prepare the way for Antichriſt. Finally all <hi>Lutherans</hi> boaſt, that Antichriſt was diſcouered by <hi>Luther.</hi>

               </p>

                  <p>But he might haue done well to haue diſproued <hi>Bellarmins</hi> diſtinction betwixt Catholikes and heretikes, which he affirmeth to conſiſt in this, that Catholikes know, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhall not come but in the end of the world: but He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes thinke that antichriſt ſhall come long before the end of the world: and ſoe we ſee, that all the Fathers, which thought that Antichriſt was at hand, thought the ſame like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the end of the world. So that, if they had liued ſo long that they might haue ſeene their coniectures about the end of the world confuted by experience, they would haue bene farre from <hi>M.

And the reaſon would haue bene, for that they would ſtill haue remayned Catholikes, who ioyne both togeather; and not haue bene of <hi>M.

To which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwereth in theſe words: <hi>Phocas gaue not the title of Vniuerſall to the Pope, but called him the head of the Churches.

Downam</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> obiected this, whereas it is moſt manifeſt that he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth an obiection. Secondlie he addeth, that <hi>good authors</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Phocas gaue not the title of <hi>Vniuerſall</hi> to the Pope, &amp; that which hee gaue, the Pope had before.</note> 
                     <hi>affirme, that he receyued from Phocas, both the title of the Head of the Church, and alſo of Vniuerſall or Oecumenicall bishop:</hi> but they are too good to be named, or els <hi>M. Downam</hi> was aſhamed of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and therefore he muſt pardon vs, if we belieue neither him, nor them, till we know what they are. Thirdlie he auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that, <hi>there is no doubt, but that Bonifacius ſought for, and by ſuite obteyned that, which Iohn of Conſtantinople had before claymed.</hi> But if he had remembred, what himſelfe wrote in his 1. chap. of his former booke, of <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> the great, his diſlike of that title in <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he would haue ſeene,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15294:43"/> that there had bene great doubt, whether <hi>Bonifacius</hi> were not more likelie to approue his holy predeceſſors iudgment in refuſing that title for due reſpectes, though otherwiſe neuer ſoe due to him, rather then his proud aduerſaries opinion in deſiring, or vſing it at that tyme, when at leaſtwiſe in that <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinoples</hi> ſenſe, it was not only ſcandalous, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See part.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</note> but perfidiouſlie falſe alſo. Wherfore keeping the dignitie it ſelfe, they vſed ſuch wordes as might modeſtlie expreſſe, what they had, and no way ſignifie that which they had not themſelues, and much leſſe <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who moſt arrogantlie vſurped that falſe, and alſo fooliſh title, being taken in the ſenſe, in which he vſurped it. Fourthly <hi>M. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> would ſhift of the matter, with ſaying, <hi>that there is no great difference betwixt theſe two titles, as they are now giuen to the Pope, ſaue that to be the head of the Vniuerſall Church, is the more Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian ſtile.</hi> But this will not ſerue his turne neither, for howſoeuer theſe titles be all one in ſubſtance, yet ſince <hi>Chytra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and others will giue vs a reaſon, why they aſſigne the firſt degree of Antichriſts comming in the tyme of <hi>Phocas;</hi> to wit, becauſe he firſt gaue the Pope the title of <hi>Vniuerſall Bishop,</hi> it is not inough, when this is denied, to tell vs, that at leaſt, if he gaue him not that, he gaue him another as great: for all the force of the argument conſiſteth in this, that this title of <hi>Phocas</hi> is a new one, which the Pope neuer had giuen him before; for otherwiſe there is no reaſon, why Antichriſt ſhould be thought more to come in <hi>Phocas</hi> his tyme, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And this was that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwered, and <hi>M. Downam</hi> hitherto hath not ſaid any thing to the purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore laſtly he goeth about to make vs belieue, that though he cannot deny, but that the Pope had the ſame title which <hi>Phocas</hi> gaue him long before: yet there was a great difference in the ſenſe and meaning. For he affirmeth, that <hi>before this graunt of</hi> Phocas, <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>had the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence and ſuperioritie, ouer all other Churches, excepting that of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, <hi>not in reſpect of Authoritie and Iuriſdiction; but in reſpect of order and dignitie, and for this cauſe eſpeciallie, becauſe</hi> Rome <hi>wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was Bishop, was the chiefe Cittie:</hi> for which he citeth the <hi>Councells</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> &amp; <hi>Conſtantinople. And for the ſame cauſe</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15294:43"/> he) <hi>was the Patriarch of Conſtantinople ſometymes matched with him: for</hi> which he citeth <hi>Concil. Chalcedon: ſometime preferred aboue him;</hi> for which he noteth in the margent <hi>tempore Maurity; becauſe Conſtantinople (which they called new Rome) was become the Imperiall ſeate:</hi> yea he addeth, that <hi>the Bishops of Rauenna, becauſe their Cittie was the chiefe in the Exarchy of Rauenna, wherevnto Rome was for a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Downams anſwere or replie confuted by Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> 
                     <hi>tyme ſubiect, ſtroue with the Bishop of Rome in the tyme of the Exarchies, for ſuperiority.</hi> But all this diſcourſe of his, is refuted at large by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his ſecond Booke of the Pope: and if <hi>M. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> will looſe ſo much labour about the anſwering of that, as he hath done about this other, which is the third, he ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be confuted, &amp; I hope fully ſatisfied in this point alſo. But now it were to great a labour to put downe all <hi>Bellarmines</hi> proofes. Wherefore both I and <hi>M. Downam</hi> muſt of reaſon be content with briefly anſwering his obiections, though that alſo in truth were not to be expected in this place, but that I deſire that <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſhould haue no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne. And firſt that the reaſon, why <hi>Rome</hi> had the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence <note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Romes prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the chiefe Citty.</note> ouer all other Churches, was not becauſe it was the chiefe Cittie, as <hi>M.

Downam</hi> mentioneth, he hath theſe wordes. <hi>Let the Cittie of Conſtantinople haue, as wee wish her, glorie and Gods right hand prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting her; let her enioy a long reigne of your Clemencie:</hi> Alia tamen ratio eſt rerum ſaecularium, alia diuinarum &amp;c. <hi>Yet worldly, and diuine thinges haue different reaſons: neither will any other building be firme and ſtable beſides that rock which our Lord hath put in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. He looſeth his owne, who deſireth thoſe thinges which are not his due. Let it ſuffice that by the foreſaid help of your Pietie, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of my ſauour, he hath obteyned the Bishoprick of ſo great a Cittie:</hi> non dedignetur Regiam Ciuitatem, quam Apoſtolica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non poteſt facere Sedem, <hi>let him not diſdaine a Kinglie Cittie, which he cannot make an Apoſtolicall Sea.</hi> So that <hi>M.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15294:44"/> which as you ſee S. <hi>Leo</hi> ſaith, by no meanes can be. Likwiſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth the authoritie of <hi>Gelaſius, Epiſtola ad Epiſcopos Dardaniae,</hi> who likewiſe reaſoneth thus. <hi>Millan, Rauenna, Syrmiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Treuers and Nicomedia were the Seates of the Empire many tymes, and yet the Fathers neuer gaue any preheminence or Primacy to thoſe Bishops, as neither they would haue done to Rome only for that reſpect.</hi>

                  <p>And as for the authority of the two Councells, <hi>M.

And if by the Councell of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> he meaneth the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, commonly called the <hi>Canons of the ſixt Generall Councell</hi> (as it ſeemes he doth) he muſt likwiſe be tould, that thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, are of no accompt, as not made by that Councell, but by certaine Biſhops, which afterward met priuately togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as appeareth by the beginning of the Canons the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues and by the confeſſion of <hi>Tharaſius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the 7. generall Councell Act. 4. and <hi>Bede</hi> calleth them, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raticam Synodum, an erring Synode,</hi> &amp; moreouer writeth, that <hi>Sergius</hi> then Pope, reiected them <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de ſex atatibus, in Iuſtinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Iuniore.</hi> And all this, and much more to the purpoſe might <note place="margin">Downam ſeemeth not to haue read ſo much of Bellarm. as he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth.</note>

                  <p n="1">1. IT pleaſeth <hi>M. Downam</hi> to be a little merrie about theſe 6.

But I will leaue it to the Readers iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it be not more likely, that he is loaden with folly.

                  <p n="2">2. But comming to anſwere the firſt demonſtration, it is wonderfull to ſee how many wordes he ſpendeth in vaine, and how few to the purpoſe. For he being to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere <hi>Bellarmines</hi> proofes, which I haue alleadged, he ſcarſe euer toucheth any of them, but maketh a long diſcourſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather friuolous, about the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that whole place <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. Wherefore I ſhalbe inforced to gather vp heere and there ſome ſcattered denialls, and ſo replie to this his broken and confuſed anſwere.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And firſt to the Fathers which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleadgeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV. V."/> as his chiefeſt proofe, I find only theſe wordes of his: <hi>Or to</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> other proofe was out of the text, becauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> by that great tribulation, before which it is ſaid, that the Ghoſpell ſhalbe preached in the whole world; the Fathers, and in particuler <hi>S.

                  <p n="5">5. Yea, that which is worſe, becauſe he would ſeeme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> to ſay ſomething, he beareth the Reader in hand, that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> had bene ſo ſimple, as to prooue his concluſion only <note place="margin">Downam omitteth Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines proofes &amp; anſwereth his owne.</note> out of thoſe wordes <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. <hi>This ghoſpell of the Kingdome shalbe preached in the whole world in teſtimony to all Nations.</hi> And then he anſwereth verie grauelie. <hi>But our Sauiour Chriſt doth not ſaie, that the Ghoſpell shalbe preached throughout the world, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Antichriſt, but before the end.</hi> And is not this to get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of his Aduerſaries reach, and then to ſhew great valour in playing his prize by himſelfe alone, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ayre?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Another tricke of <hi>M.

And if he would haue ſaid any thing to the purpoſe, he ſhould haue tould vs, how the Ghoſpell can be preached to any Nation, when the perſecution is ſo great and generall, that all publike exerciſe of true Religion doth ceaſe in all places, throughout the whole world. And this is all, that he bringeth in anſwere to the arguments. Wherfore only there remayneth, that we ſee, whether he proueth his owne expoſition in thoſe two pointes, in which he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Fathers, any better.</p>

For how could the Apoſtles feare, leaſt togeather with <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> Chriſts Church ſhould be ouerthrowne? ſince as he himſelfe ſaith, the Temple and

And were not he a wiſe man, thinke you, that would go about to comfort Catholikes, by telling them, that they muſt not be afrayd, though they ſee heretikes aboliſhed, who are their chiefeſt aduerſaries? ſince that the preuailing of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes conſiſteth chiefly in the aboliſhing of heretikes?

                  <p n="9">9. After this againe he ſaith, <hi>that wee may not thinke, that our Sauiour Chriſt would intermingle the Propheſies, concerning the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, and the end of the world, therby to nourish the</hi>

And this experience alſo teacheth, ſince as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in part ſheweth in the former Chapter and firſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, the holy Fathers expected our Sauiours comming euery one in his tyme. And this is that which they thinke to appeare both by the Apoſtles queſtion, and our Sauiours anſwere; for they ſeemed to be doubtfull of it, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour leaueth them as doubtfull in this point.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Thirdly, <hi>M.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:15294:49"/> part only: &amp; to haue no coherence with that, which goeth immediatly before, which is as great a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as may be. And becauſe he ſaw it himſelfe, he imagineth our B.

For our Sauiour ſaith not <hi>(all thoſe thinges)</hi> as though they were thinges a farre of, but <hi>(theſe thinges)</hi> of which he had ſpoken. <hi>S. Matthew, Omnia haec, S.

                  <p>But now to come to that, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would proue; <hi>M. Downam</hi> firſt is inforced to yeild, that <hi>theſe ten hornes ſignify</hi> 10. <hi>Kinges, which shall raigne togeather,</hi> and only can help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with affirming, <hi>that theſe are not the ſame ten hornes whereof</hi> Daniel <hi>ſpeaketh, which raigned ſucceſſiuelie.</hi> For which point I remit my ſelfe to that, which hath byn ſaid in the former proofe; beſides that it is no ſmall confirmation that <hi>S.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the whole precedent diſcourſe. Well it is now at length agreed vpon, that there ſhall 10. Kinges raigne togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherfore it only remayneth to proue, that in the time of theſe 10. Kings, there ſhal be no <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ſhalbe vtterly deſtroyed; and ſo it is tyme for <hi>M.

                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:15294:57"/> firſt propoſition, in the beginning of the queſtion for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in this place, and not truly neither. But it will be beſt to heare <hi>M. Downams</hi> owne wordes. <hi>How then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth Bellarmine proue, that before Antichriſt commeth, the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire shallbe ſo vtterly deſtroyed, as not the name of a Roman Emperour or King of the Romans should remayne? becauſe the Empire shallbe deuided among</hi> 10. <hi>Kinges which are not Roman Kinges &amp;c.</hi> Wheras <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> wordes are theſe: <hi>VVe muſt know that the Roman Empire is at length to be deuided into ten Kinges, of which none shalbe, or be called King of the Romans:</hi> where you ſee not only the being, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the name of <hi>Roman</hi> Kinges is excluded. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith <hi>M.

                  </p>
                  <p>This found and fooliſh conceipt, that the beaſt which was, and is not, is the Emperour erected by the Pope, ſhall in other places be largely confuted. Now I would only know, how this Emperour can be, when the whole Empire is deuided among thoſe other 10. Kinges, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and proueth out of this very place, as we ſhould haue ſeene ere this, had not <hi>M. Downam</hi> interrupted vs with his impertinent diſgreſſions, which perhaps foreſeeing and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, he putteth another queſtion ſomewhat more to the purpoſe. <hi>And why may none of theſe be called the King of the Romans? firſt forſooth, becauſe they shall hate Rome, and make her deſolate.</hi> But he might haue kept his <hi>(firſt)</hi> &amp; <hi>(forſooth)</hi> in his purſe inſteed of money: for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> giueth but one reaſon, which is the foreſaid wordes of Scripture, adding only the expoſition of them, which becauſe <hi>M. Downam</hi> could not impugne, he though beſt to deuide, that ſo hauing ſeparated the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the place of Scripture, the one might want autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the other be eaſily ſhifted of, as he doth in theſe words: <hi>As though he that hath the title of the King of the Romans, may not hate Rome, notwithſtanding that title, as indeed ſome of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours haue done:</hi> which euaſion had byn too ridiculous, if he had added <hi>Bellarmines</hi> expoſition, to wit, that the Scripture teſtifieth that theſe <hi>Kings shal hate the harlot, and make her deſolate and naked, and shall eate her flesh, and shal burne her with fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:15294:58"/> 
                     <hi>they shall ſo deuide the Roman Empire amongſt them, that they shall vtterlie deſtroy it.</hi> Where by the way <hi>M.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> might haue done well to haue found vs out ſome one Father, that had fauoured his expoſition; which he negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, not for want of good will, as wee ſee plainelie by his citing of <hi>S.

But I hope men will rather haue the Apoſtle, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſtand by them in the day of iudgment, when they ſhall giue accompt of their fayth, in this point, then <hi>M. Downam,</hi> who will haue more then he can doe, to anſwere for himſelfe. The Holy Ghoſt wel foreſaw, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ſhould be in theſe tymes, as we now ſee it, and no doubt would not haue affirmed ſo abſolutely, that it hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Antichriſts comming, if at any tyme it could haue bene togeather with him, or haue furthered him; otherwiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII.

                     <note place="margin">There now a Roman Emperour indeed, &amp; not in name or title only.</note> would giue vs to vnderſtand: for there is <hi>now an Emperour of the Romans indeed, and not only in title without the thing it ſelfe,</hi> as we ſee the whole world acknowledgeth, euen the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants themſelues; and who but <hi>M.

                  <p>But here wee muſt not paſſe ouer in ſilence <hi>M. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nams</hi> iuggling trickes: for in his opinion the ſecond Beaſt with two hornes is Antichriſt; for ſo he obiecteth to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now that the wordes of our Lord <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the true <hi>Helias,</hi> yt is plaine; becauſe <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> alreadie come, and had abſolued his courſe, and yet our Lord ſaith, <hi>Helias</hi> ſhall come: and that they are not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of all doctors, but of one true <hi>Helias,</hi> it may be proued, firſt, becauſe the Apoſtles, who moued the queſtion of <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> where <hi>S. Peter, S. Iames,</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> and they tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by the Transfiguration of our Lord, where they ſaw <hi>Moyſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Helias;</hi> wherefore when they aske; <hi>why therefore doe the Scribes ſay, that</hi> Helias <hi>muſt come firſt?</hi> they ſpeake of that <hi>Helias,</hi> whome they had ſeene in the mountayne with Chriſt. Therefore Chriſt anſwering, <hi>Helias indeed shall come &amp; reſtore all thinges,</hi> ſpeaketh alſo of that particuler Helias who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Transfiguration. Secondly the ſame is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt out of thoſe wordes, <hi>and he shall reſtore all thinges;</hi> for <hi>S. Io. Baptiſt</hi> nor any other hath don that: for toreſtore all thinges is to recall all Iewes, and heretikes, and perhappes many
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15294:62"/> Catholikes (deceaued by Antichriſt) to the true Faith.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But <hi>Bibliander</hi> vrgeth, becauſe our Lord <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. ſaith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> of <hi>S. Io. Baptiſt, He is Helias, who is to come,</hi> as if he had ſaid: He is the <hi>Helias</hi> promiſed by <hi>Malachy.</hi> I anſwere: Our Lordes meaning is, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was the <hi>Helias</hi> promiſed, not litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but allegoricallie; for therefore he ſaid firſt, <hi>and if you will receaue him,</hi> as if he ſaid, <hi>Helias</hi> indeed promiſed in his owne perſon is to come in the laſt comming; yet if you will haue alſo ſome <hi>Helias</hi> in the firſt comming, receaue <hi>Iohn;</hi> Therefore alſo he addeth: <hi>He that hath eares to heare let him heare,</hi> ſignifying, that it was a myſtery, that he had ſaid <hi>S. Iohn</hi> to be <hi>Helias.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Finally that the wordes of <hi>S. Io. Apoc.</hi> 11. are vnderſtood <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> of the particuler perſons <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Helias,</hi> not of all teachers, it is manifeſt by that which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſaith in the ſame place, that they <hi>were to be killed</hi> by Antichriſt, and that <hi>their bodies should remayne vnburyed three dayes in the ſtreets of Hieruſalem,</hi> &amp; that, <hi>after three daies they should riſe againe, and aſcend into Heauen;</hi> which neuer happened to any hitherto.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Notwithſtanding <hi>Dauid Chytraeus</hi> goeth about to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> in his Commentary vpon that place, and he ſaith firſt, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> would ſignifie, that many <hi>Lutheran Miniſters</hi> were to bee ſlaine by the Papiſtes, whome notwithſtanding God reſtoreth to life, when he taketh them vp to Heauen to liue for euer. Secondly he addeth a little after, that thoſe ſlaine Miniſters ſhall haue their corporall life reſtored them in the laſt daie of Reſurrection. Thirdlie and laſtly he addeth in the ſame place, that by this reſtoring to life, may alſo be ſignified, that wee ſee many other Miniſters raiſed by God, inſteed of thoſe which were ſlaine, with the ſame zeale &amp; vertue.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But theſe anſweres are too light: for the firſt ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, becauſe the bleſſednes of the ſoule, is not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> of our life loſt, but an obteyning of a new life. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, thoſe two witneſſes in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> ſhall riſe againe before many, and ſhalbe lifted vp in Body, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie is not fulfilled in the bleſſednes of the ſoule. Likewiſe the ſecond ſolution is nothing worth, for <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſaith, that thoſe two witneſſes ſhall riſe againe, before the laſt daie,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:15294:63"/> to wit, while the ſtate of this world endureth, for <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that their enemies ſhalbe <hi>ſtroken into a great feare</hi> by that reſurrection, and that a little after, there ſhalbe <hi>an earth-quak &amp; that</hi> 7000. <hi>men shall perish.</hi> Finally the third ſolution is not to the purpoſe, for the Scripture ſaith, that the very ſame which were dead <hi>shalbe raiſed againe,</hi> and aſſumpted into Heauen. But yet we ſee not any <hi>Lutheran</hi> Miniſter riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or be taken vp to heauen. Likewiſe S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Helias, shall preach in ſackcloth,</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans</hi> beare ſuch an hatred to ſackloth, that if peraduenture they haue any when they become <hi>Lutherans,</hi> they forthw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondlie, it is proued that <hi>Helias,</hi> and <hi>Henoch</hi> ſhall come in their owne perſons in Antichriſts tyme, by the conſent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> of the Fathers. For of <hi>Helias</hi> ſo affirme <hi>S. Hilarie, S. Hierome, Origen, S. Chryſoſtome,</hi> and all other interpreters of <hi>S. Matth. in cap.</hi> 17.

               <p>
                  <q>Of <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Helias</hi> togeather, ſo affirme many which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> write vpon the <hi>Apoc.</hi> as <hi>Bede, Richardus, Arethas,</hi> who alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that <hi>it is without varietie belieued by the whole Church, that Henoch and Elias are to come to oppoſe themſelues to Antichriſt.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly it is proued, becauſe otherwiſe there can be no reaſon giuen, why theſe two were taken away before their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> death, &amp; liue ſtill in mortall fleſh, being at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to dy: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Iews as <hi>Rab.

And to begin this his ſecond Anſwere, he firſt citeth <hi>Bellarmines</hi> wordes falſelie, making him ſay thus: <hi>There be</hi> 4. <hi>Scriptures to prooue that Henoch and Helias in their owne perſons shall come againſt Antichriſt.</hi> As though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had affirmed, that in euerie Scripture of theſe foure, both <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Helias</hi> had byn named, or at leaſtwiſe ſpoken of; for ſo M. <hi>Downam</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to charge him ſaying forth with: <hi>Howbeit this is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt vntruth, for no place of Scripture speaketh of Henoch his returne.</hi> But <hi>Bellarmines</hi> words are theſe: <hi>Quatuor Scripturae exſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t de haec re. There be foure Scriptures co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this matter.</hi> Now whether any of theſe places ſpeake of <hi>Henoch</hi> his returne or no, we ſhall ſee <note place="margin">Downam alleageth Bellarmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des falſlie.</note> ere long: in the meane tyme it is ſufficient, that the Reader note <hi>M.

                  <p>Wherefore leauing theſe his ſhiftes, let vs heare what he can anſwere to that place of <hi>Malachy.</hi> He denieth that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II.

                        <hi>Malach.</hi> 4.</note> will needes prooue alſo, becauſe Luc. 1. the Angell ſaith, that S. <hi>Iohn should go before our Lord in the ſpirit and vertue of Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>

But we will beare with his rudeneſſe, ſo that he will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:15294:64"/> with any reaſon. Wherfore ſecondly, be bringeth <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. where he ſaith, that <hi>our Saviour moſt plainaly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,</hi>

                     </hi> would make <note place="margin">Downam corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Scripture.</note> him; but <hi>who is to come;</hi> ſignifying plainely, that <hi>S.

                  <p>Thirdly <hi>M. Downa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> alleageth <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> who affirmeth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I. V."/> 
                     <hi>that the Iewes and Iudaizing Heretikes thinke, that before their Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Elias shall come, and reſtore all thinges. Hence it is, that vnto Chriſt this queſtion is propounded in the Ghoſpell, what is that, which the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies ſay, that Elias shall come? To whom he anſwered: Elias indeed shall come, and if you will belieue, he is alreadie come: by Elias meaning Iohn. And therefore</hi> (ſaith M. Downam) <hi>in</hi> Hieromes <hi>iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it is but the opinion of a Iudaizing heretike to expect the comming againe of Elias in his owne perſon.</hi> But ſure wee are, that this is not <hi>S.

                     </hi> thinketh, that Helias is not litterally ſpoken of. In which point he erreth more groſſely then they, as we ſhall ſee afterward.</p>

                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:15294:65"/> 3. Now, that <hi>M. Downam</hi> hath ſpent his owne proofes be is content to begin to anſwere <hi>Bellarmines,</hi> who proueth that <hi>Malachy</hi> ſpeaketh of the ſecond comming, becauſe he calleth it <hi>a great and horrible day.</hi> Where <hi>M. Downam</hi> is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſay, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> giueth <hi>the lie to the ſpirit of God, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Angel, Luc.</hi> 1. and our Sauiour <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. &amp; 17. But <note place="margin">Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudenty.</note> ſurely he deſerueth to haue the lye giuen him, that is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid nor aſhamed to behaue himſelfe ſo impudently. VVell it is our hard happe to haue to doe with ſuch men. Let vs ſee, what he anſwereth: <hi>for the application of the Angell, and our Sauiour,</hi> wee haue already ſeene, that it was only a ſpirituall, vertuall, or allegoricall application, which hindereth not the litterall ſenſe of the ſecond comming, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Malach.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</note> But <hi>M. Downam</hi> anſwereth to his argument, that the firſt comming may alſo be called terrible, which he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out of <hi>Malac.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>where he ſpeaketh moſt plainly of the firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and yet ſaith: who may abyde the day of his comming? and who shall endure, when he appeareth, for he is like a purging fier, and like fullers ſope, and he shall ſit downe to try, and fine the ſiluer.</hi> But we may well oppoſe the authority of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> to <hi>M. Downam,</hi> without doing him iniury. He therfore <hi>lib.</hi> 18. <hi>Ciu. cap.</hi> 35. and <hi>lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. as likewiſe <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>demonſt. Euang. cap.</hi> 28. and <hi>Theodoretus</hi> expound theſe wordes of the ſecond comming, though immediately before the Prophet ſpake of the firſt. But yet we will do <hi>M. Downam</hi> the courteſy to graunt that they are to be vnderſtood of the firſt with <hi>S. Cyril, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertus</hi> and others, ſo that he will admit their interpretation in other points: for the ſenſe is; who can ſo much as think how great the glory of this day is, by reaſon of the benefites which the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhall bring with him to mankind? and who can ſufficiently admire or rather looke vpon ſo great a light and goodneſſe? For he ſhalbe like a purging fyre, by reaſon of the labours and afflictions, or rather of the holy Ghoſt, which ſhall come in fyery tongues, with which he ſhall purge the hartes of thoſe which belieue in him, &amp; like the ſope or her be of Fullers, by reaſon of his grace, with which he ſhall make the ſoules of men moſt pure and white; and he ſhall do this moſt ſeriouſly, and with great diligence All which ſignifyeth not the torrible and horrible day, but
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15294:65"/> an acceptable and healthſome tyme. And heere by the way wee may note, what little reaſon <hi>M. Downam,</hi> and his fellowes haue to leaue <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> vulgar tranſlation, who <note place="margin">Downam admitteth what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth</note> hath: <hi>Quis poterit cogitare,</hi> and tranſlate with other interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Quis ſuſtinebit?</hi> Except they would admit the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of them, which read it ſo? But they will admit what they liſt, and reiect what they liſt, and one while they will haue vs belieue, that the Ghoſpell terrifieth not at all, and an otherwhile, that it terrifieth as much as the old law, yea much more, euen aſmuch as the ſecond comming of our Lord to iudgment. But ſince they take ſo much liberty to teach what they liſt, we may likewiſe take leaue to belieue them, ſo farre as we liſt.</p>
                  <p>VVel, let vs ſee how <hi>M. Downam</hi> goeth forward to proue that the firſt comming of our Lord may be called terrible: Of the ſame comming (ſaith he) the prophet ſpeaketh in the beginning of the 4. Chap. <hi>Behould the day commeth that shal burne</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>as an ouen</hi> &amp;c. ſhewing how terrible it ſhalbe to the wicked. <hi>But vnto yow that feare my name</hi> (ſaith the Lord <hi>v.</hi> 2.) <hi>shall the ſunne of righteouſnes ariſe, and health shalbe vnder his winges</hi> &amp;c. But here we are conſtrayned to forſake <hi>M. Downam,</hi> ſince both Iewes and Chriſtians conſent, that theſe wordes are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the day of iudgment, and the wordes themſelues are ſo playne, that they need no interpretation: and it was tyme for him to adde <hi>(&amp;c.)</hi> in both periods, for otherwiſe euery man would haue ſeene, that the <hi>proud and wicked are not to be conſumed as ſtubble caſt into the fire</hi> till then, as neyther, <hi>that they shall be trodden vnder the ſeete of the iuſt like ashes,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet affirmeth that they ſhall be in this great and terrible <note place="margin">Downam cutteth of the words which make moſt to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> day. Wherfore this illation maketh plainely for vs, if <hi>M. Downam</hi> will ſhew vs as much courteſie now, as we did him in the former Chapter, that is, to graunt, that the Prophet continueth ſtill to ſpeake of the ſame comming; though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we need no ſuch fauour, ſince that in the very place in controuerſy, this comming is called great and horrible, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vrgeth. But <hi>M. Downam</hi> goeth on ſtill with his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Now is the axe laid to the roote of the tree &amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>his hand</hi> (vſing the like fimilitude that <hi>Malachy</hi> did) <hi>and will purge his floore, &amp; gather his wheat into his Granary, but wil burne vp the chaffe with vnquenchable fier.</hi> All which maketh very little to the purpoſe: for the ſenſe is, that heerafter the Iewes ſhall haue no priuiledge aboue other Nations, by being the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> except they did imitate his workes: and that our Sauiours Baptiſme was of more force, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſts,</hi> becauſe he would ſend the holy Ghoſt viſible in tierie ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, for which cauſe he is ſaid to be mightier then <hi>S.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable fier; which who ſeeth not, that it ſhall be chiefly at his ſecond comming, and in ſome ſort in euery mans par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler iudgement, but in no wiſe at his firſt comming? And the reſt ſeemeth nothing terrible, except perhappes to the Iewes; but that were without reaſon alſo, ſince they are not made in any worſe eſtate, then they were before, but only other Nations are in better; ſo that their priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is made common with others, or rather inſteed of their particuler priuiledge, they receaue a common benefit greater without compariſon.</p>
                  <p>Finally <hi>M. Downam</hi> bringeth the propheſy of ould <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon Luc.</hi> 2. that our <hi>Sauiour was put to the ruyne, and riſing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. he is called <hi>a ſtumbling ſtone, and a rock of offence;</hi>

                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> as <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, and to fall vpon this ſtone, is to be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized, and not to belieue in Chriſt, which is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery <note place="margin">

And thus we ſee that the firſt comming of our B.

                  <p>All theſe places of Scripture being thus eaſilie anſwered, it was no meruaile, though <hi>M. Downa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> reſted not content, &amp; therfore anſwereth further, <hi>that the Hebrew word</hi> Norah <hi>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth alſo Reuerend, to be feared, or had in reuerence, as Gen.</hi> 28. 17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>and ſo is tranſlated by</hi> Tremelius <hi>and</hi> Iunius <hi>in this place of Malachie. And thus both that word, and others of the ſame roote are vſed in the ſignification of reuerence, or filiall feare.</hi> And he citeth in the margent <hi>pſal.</hi> 13. 4. But <hi>M.

Wherefore ſince the word may ſignifie both <hi>reuerence</hi> and <hi>terrour,</hi> and beſides moſt vſuallie it ſignifieth <hi>terrour,</hi> &amp; particulerlie in this place by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of all ancient interpreters &amp; Fathers; we ſee no reaſon why we ſhould imbrace this new particuler opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather take the ſame ſenſe in this place, which is manifeſt, that the ſame words haue <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. except <hi>M.

                     </hi> can ſhew vs, that the <hi>Sun was turned into darkenes, and the Moone into bloud,</hi> before the firſt comming of our Sauiour. Finally there is no doubt, but that the ſecond comming is as full of <hi>reuerence,</hi> and <hi>filiall feare</hi> as the firſt, and conſequently euen
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15294:67"/> in this ſenſe alſo were to be called <hi>horible</hi> and <hi>terrible.</hi> Thus much for the 1. proofe, that <hi>Malac.</hi> ſpake of the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> his ſecond proofe is, becauſe it is added, <hi>leaſt perhapps I come, and ſtrike the earth with a curſe:</hi> which <hi>M.

But he might eaſily haue bethought himſelfe, that at his firſt comming, without peraduenture, our Sauiour was reſolued not to ſtrike the earth with cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but to repleniſh it with bleſſings: &amp; this reſolution aroſe not from any merits, or good diſpoſition of any, that liued eyther then, or before, or after: but from his owne infinite mercy and goodnes, by which he vouchſafed to make vs his friends: being of our ſelues his enemies ſo vniuerſally, that there was not one that could appeaſe his wrath: and I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle much, that <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſhould vpon the ſuddaine, only to auoide an argument, attribute more to merits then euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Downam attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth more to merits the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike did.</note> Catholike did, wherfore we may well hope, that he wil admit free will alſo, without which there is no merit, and which indeed that <hi>(peraduenture)</hi> ſignifyeth in this place: for in reſpect of Gods decre and knowledg, there could be no doubt, what he was to do at either comming, but only how we would diſpoſe our ſelues, which by al probability thoſe, which ſhal liue at our Sauiours ſecond comming, and aboue others the Iewes, would not do in any good ſort; eſpecially hauing then more hinderances, by reaſon of Antichriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, then euer before; had they not the aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of theſe two holy Prophets <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Helias.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Downam</hi> prayſeth, as he did before <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> becauſe he <note place="margin">Ianſenius</note> maketh for him, <hi>to be one of the beſt writers among the Papiſts,</hi> there had byn no great cauſe of his commending him, if <hi>M. Downam</hi> had bene diſpoſed to haue dealt ſincerely, ſince <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> ſhewed, how he changed his opinion in <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:15294:68"/> where he writeth that the Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> cannot be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood but of the true <hi>Elias,</hi> and conſequently muſt needes <note place="margin">Downam dealeth not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the obiection &amp; omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the anſwere</note> thinke, that <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> was not deceaued in vnderſtanding him ſo. But this is another of <hi>M. Downams</hi> tricks, to ſteale an obiection from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and omit his anſwere: where we might meruayle at his impudent folly, but that it is no new nor ſtrange thing in him, as it was in <hi>Ianſenius</hi> or any Catholike Writer, to attribute an errour to Canonicall Scripture, which was the cauſe of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> meruayling at <hi>Ianſenius,</hi> and of his changing ſo abſurd an opinion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther errour in his later writings, in which he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auouch and prooue this truth, but alſo affirmeth that it is the doctrine of the Catholike Church, which none but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I.

                        <hi>Eccleſiaſt.</hi> 44.</note> 
                     <hi>a wonder, that</hi> Bellarmine <hi>would alleage it for this purpoſe. But that hauing nothing to ſay to the purpoſe, he is deſirous to ſay ſomething to bleare the eyes of the ſimple. The originall text hath;</hi> Henoch <hi>pleaſed the Lord God, and was tranſlated for an example of repentance to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations; that is, that the generations preſent and to come, might be moued by his example to turne vnto the Lord, and to walke before him, knowing by his example, that there is a reward layd vp for thoſe that turne vnto the Lord, and walke before him, as</hi> Henoch <hi>did. But will</hi> Bellarmine <hi>hence conclude, that therfore</hi> Henoch <hi>is to come agayne in the flesh, to oppoſe himſelfe to Antichriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto <hi>M. Downam.</hi> And this is all he hath to ſay. Where firſt we ſee, that he cannot deny, but that the latin text, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cited, made much for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and there is no reaſon, but that we ſhould attribute as much at leaſt, to the latin interpretation, as to <hi>M. Downams</hi> interpretation: ſince it cannot be denyed, but that there is <note place="margin">The latin interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not to be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> leſſe ſuſpition of partiality in him, being ſo ancient, who made no doubt of the ſenſe, and therfore tranſlated it in that ſorte, as it were to exclude <hi>M. Downams</hi> deuiſe; and ſince the latin Church hath all this tyme receaued this tranſlation for Scripture, we muſt not deny it now, becauſe it is contrary to ſome Proteſtant opinions, eſpecially ſince we ſee far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difference in other partes of Scripture, betwixt the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall text, &amp; ſome interpretations allowed by the Church:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:15294:69"/> neither of which the Fathers durſt reiect, but rather imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and expounded them both, as the word of God: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed who knoweth not, that the chiefeſt certainty, that we haue of either, dependeth vpon the approbation and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church, which cannot erre in matters of this moment. And I belieue <hi>M. Downam</hi> will hardly giue vs any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſufficient reaſon, why he belieueth theſe bookes to be Scripture, rather then others, or this interpretation to be good, and others bad. But beſides the authority of the latin text, we thinke the Greeke to be for vs alſo, at leaſtwiſe no man can deny, but that our expoſition is conformable to the Fathers doctrine, who affirme our aſſertion of <hi>Henochs</hi> comming, and conſequently we are ſure, that we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expound it ſo, without danger of errour, and that <hi>M.

And then hee giueth a ſecond ſolution, <hi>vel propter illam iniquorum abundantiam, &amp; paucitatem bonorum:</hi> or by reaſon of that aboundance of the wicked, and ſcarcitie of the good.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:15294:71"/> of the world, the infirmitie of man was at length to vtter theſe doubtfull wordes. Thus farre <hi>S.

                  <p>The other obiection, which <hi>M. Downam</hi> intrudeth in this place of the vncertainty of our Sauiours comming, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the next chapter but one, where it ſhalbe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Now it is ſufficient to examine that, which is brought in due place, of which ſort there remayneth nothing, but <hi>M. Downams</hi> interpretation, how <hi>S.

                        </gap>o Dominus Ieſus Chriſtus &amp;c. Our lord Ieſus Chriſt would prefigure his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comming in S. Iohn Baptiſt, and ſay that S.

                     <note place="margin">S. Aug. maketh no more doubt that Elias shall come, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that S. Io. Bap. is come.</note> 
                     <hi>two cryers; the ſame Iudge, but two cryers, not two Iudges: &amp; the Iudge was firſt to come to be iudged; he ſent before him his firſt cryer, called him Elias, becauſe Elias shalbe that in the ſecond comming, which S. Iohn was in the firſt. For let your Charity conſider how true it is, that I ſay, when S. Iohn was conceaued, or rather when he was borne, the holy Ghoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied thus of him, and he shalbe the forerunner of the higheſt in the ſpirit &amp; vertue of Elias. Then he was not Elias, but in the ſpirit and vertue of Elias. VVhat ſigniſyeth, in the ſpirit and vertue of Elias? In the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, inſteed of Elias. VVhy inſteed of Elias? Becauſe that which Elias shalbe in the ſecond comming, S. Iohn was at the firſt. VVherfore rightly S. Iohn anſwered.</hi> Ioan 1. <hi>now properly. For our Lord ſaid Matth.</hi> 17. <hi>figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely Elias is Iohn, but he (as I ſaid) properly: I am not Elias. If thou conſidereſt the figure of a forerunner, S. Iohn is Elias, for that which he was at the firſt comming, the other shalbe at the ſecond. If thou ſeekeſt for the propriety of the perſon, Iohn is Iohn, Elias is Elias: wherfore our Lord for the prefiguration, ſaid rightly, he is Elias, and S. Iohn ſaid rightly for the propriety, I am not Elias &amp;c.</hi> And a little after: <hi>Numquid tu Elias es? Art thou Elias? Now if he should ſay, I am Elias, therefore Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming now in his ſecond comming should iudge, and not as yet be iudged in his firſt. As if he had ſaid, Elias is as yet alſo to come: I am not, ſaith hee, Elias: but reſpect him, being humble, before whom Iohn commeth, leaſt you feele him, being high, before whome Elias is to come. For our Lord alſo ended ſo: Iohn Baptiſt is he that it to come. He came in prefigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Elias is to come in propriety. Then Elias shalbe Elias by proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, now S. Iohn was Elias by ſimilitude: Now Iohn is Iohn by proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then Elias shalbe Iohn by ſimilitude. Both theſe Cryers haue giuen one another their ſimilitudes, and haue kept their proprietyes, but there is one Lord Iudge, whether the one or the other Cryer go before him.</hi> Thus farre <hi>S. Auguſtine.</hi> Where you ſee, he maketh no more doubt, that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall come, then that <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt</hi> is come. But he is like to be accompted among the erroneous Iewes, for his labour by <hi>M. Downam,</hi> and <hi>S.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Church of God and ancye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers, who alleage ſo much, and ſo plaine Scripture for their aſſertion. But <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſhall not need to take any thought for theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed men, for they thinke their eſtates happie though it were much worſe, then it is, in that they know, that God is moſt <note place="margin">Enoch and Elias are in Heauen</note> honoured in them ſo, and his bleſſed will moſt perfectlie fulfilled, which they, and all other perfect men eſteeme much more of, then of their owne ioy and happines. But leaſt this doctrine ſhould not ſinke into the Miniſters head, wee may alſo put him in mind, that it was alway among all people accompted a great happines to liue long in this world, ſpeciallie in good eſtate, and at eaſe; and it may be doubted, that it <hi>M. Downam</hi> might be well beneficed to his liking, he would content himſelfe to haue this priuiledge, to remaine ſo, without moleſtation to the worlds end; for it is not euerie mans caſe to be ſo deſirous to ſee God, that they would forth with forſake all worldly thinges, yea imbrace death it ſelfe, not to haue this happines differed: for very few ſo long as they liue in this world, haue their ſpirituall eyes ſo cleere, as to haue ſo great and effectuall a conceyt of <note place="margin">Caluin thinketh that only Chriſt is in Heauen &amp; that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtay without.</note> Heauen; and thoſe which haue, are of thoſe perfect, who eaſilie conforme themſelues to Gods bleſſed will in this, &amp; all other things.

                  <p>Another trifling obiection of <hi>M. Downam</hi> is, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> mentioneth <hi>neither Enoch nor Elias.</hi> As though it were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that the holie Fathers expound it ſo, and that the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are ſuch, as that they cannot with anie ſhew of probability, be applied to anie other, which is the reaſon that he himſelfe onlie goeth about to impugne, but dares <note place="margin">Downam dareth not defend his fellowes.</note> not take vpon him to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his fellow heretikes expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futeth, nor bring any other of his owne. And ſurelie, it is a great wonder, that in the Apocalyps <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſhould be ſo ouerſeene, as to ſpeake ſo darkelie, that he would leaue out the names of theſe two witneſſes. Fir allie he threatneth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with another anſwere, ſaying: <hi>But if I should adde, that</hi> Bellarmine <hi>cannot prooue, that this place trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of Antichriſt, but rather of the Beaſt with ſeauen heades ariſing out of the ſea, that is the Romayne State, either generallie or ſpeciallie vnder the Emperours, as may be gathered by comparing verſe</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. <hi>of the</hi> 11. <hi>Chap. with the</hi> 1. <hi>and</hi> 5. <hi>of the</hi> 13. <hi>I would then know to what purpoſe he alleadgeth this text to prooue, that</hi> Enoch <hi>and</hi> Elias <hi>shall come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Antichriſt, if neither the one nor the other be heere meant?</hi> Well Syt, put <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to prooue this, when you will, and you ſhall ſee, how many Authors he will bring you to prooue that both theſe places are to be vnderſtood of Antichriſt: &amp; for the later which you thinke moſt hard, you may take a view of thoſe, which he cited in the former Chapter; where I alſo added a few more. And this proofe ſhall ſuffice for this tyme: for before you and I part, I doubt not, wee ſhall diſcuſſe this matter more fully.</p>

Surely it is hard to imagine, ſince their wordes are ſo plaine, and therfore till he giueth vs a reaſon, we may iuſtly thinke, that he hath none, but was willing to delude his Reader, either by ſcoffiing or any other lewd trick he could deuiſe, for lightly he could not inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a worſe, then to ſcoffe at Gods Saints, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly at thoſe, to whom we are moſt behoulding, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which in the firſt place <hi>S.

                  <p n="8">8. Finally <hi>M. Downam</hi> anſwereth to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reaſon, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/>

                     <hi>S. Damaſus</hi> in the life of <hi>S.

                  <q>Now that the perſecution of Antichriſt, ſhalbe moſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> manifeſt and knowne, <hi>S.

But the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all ſhall break forth (ſayth <hi>S. Auguſtine)</hi> into open perſecution, out of their lurking corners of hatred. This ſurely is ſo farre of from being fulfilled at this tyme, that there was neuer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a greater number of falſe brethren, and faygned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and this perſecution is ſo farre of from being knowne and manifeſt, that neither they which ſay they ſuffer it, nor wee that are ſaid to cauſe it, can tell whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it began.</q>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Out of which three thinges may be gathered.

Secondlie, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, but moſt contrarie to him, ſince he doth chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne and defend the Sacrifice, which Antichriſt ſhall take away. Thirdlie, that the heretikes of this tyme aboue all others are the forerunners of Antichriſt; ſince they wiſh nothing more earneſtly, then vtterly to aboliſh the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Euchariſt.</q>

That theſe tymes agree not to</hi> Antiochus, <hi>we will teach in the laſt viſion.</hi> Thus farre <hi>S. Hierome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where we ſee that both theſe places are to be vnderſtood of Antichriſt, and neither of <hi>Antiochus;</hi> which appeareth alſo by that in this Chapter, aſwell as in the 12. there is expreſſe mention made of the laſt iudgment, as <hi>S.

But now by the Scripture and <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> accompt, he hath neither halfe nor parcell aboue three yeares, and yet they muſt haue an entyre halfe of <hi>M. Downam,</hi> or els he is like to ſmart for it one day.</p>
                  <p>And is not this a ſtrange conferring of Scripture thinke you, to alleadge a place of Scripture againſt himſelfe, and then to change it, becauſe otherwiſe it will not ſerue his turne? wheras indeed, if it had bene, as he would haue it, a parcell and not halfe, it had byn leaſt of all to the purpoſe, except by that parcell we ſhould haue vnderſtood an halfe: for otherwiſe it had bene cleere, that theſe two places were <note place="margin">Downa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Scripture.</note> ſpoken of diuers thinges. And this <hi>M. Downam</hi> did in ſome ſort ſee: wherefore he telleth vs, <hi>that vnto the victory obteyned by the</hi> Machabees, <hi>wherby the forces of</hi> Antiochus <hi>were expelled out of</hi> Iury, <hi>and therby the reſtitution before begun, eſtablished, were</hi> 3. <hi>yeares and a halfe, as</hi> Ioſephus <hi>teſtifieth.</hi> But this maketh nothing to the purpoſe, as neither his other accomptes of 1260. <hi>dayes to the ſtriking of</hi> Antiochus, <hi>and</hi> 1335. <hi>vnto his death</hi> (for which two later he neither citeth Scripture, or other Author) for <note place="margin">See the next Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</note> heere is no conference of Scripture at all; and beſides, if all this were ſo, which wee can hardly belieue, till it be better proued, it only ſheweth a wonderfull correſpondence betwixt <hi>Antiochus</hi> the figure, and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> whom he figured, but no way proueth, that in the places of <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. and 12. there is any mention of <hi>Antiochus;</hi> which <hi>S. Hierome</hi> hath eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſproued, and much leſſe that they were only to be <note place="margin">Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus not ſpoken of at all <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.</note> vnderſtood of him; which is that, which it behooueth <hi>M.

                  </p>
                  <p>This then being ſo, I doubt not any diſcreet and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Reader will graunt, that not only the Iewes, but
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15294:82"/> alſo the Chriſtians were to haue a continuall ſacrifice, and worſhip of God, which was not wholie to be interrupted vntill Antichriſts tyme: and againſt all <hi>M. Downams</hi> rayling, I need to oppoſe no other argument, but only this place, which is ſufficient to conuince any but obſtinate heretikes. And he bringeth not any one argument, but only affirmeth many blaſphemies without all proofe; and therefore at this tyme, the diſcreet Reader muſt expect no more but a bare <note place="margin">Downam &amp; his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters their manner of diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> denyall to a bare affirmation, for otherwiſe wee ſhould neuer make an end of iangling, if whenſoeuer he will blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, I ſhould leaue the principall queſtion, and refute other particulers altogeather from the preſent purpoſe, which ſeemeth to be that, which this Myniſter deſireth now, and the whole crew of them are wont to practiſe in all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations. Wherfore I will end this Chapter, requeſting my reader to conſider attentiuely if it be not euident out of this laſt proofe, <hi>that Antichriſt is not yet come, that the Pope is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him, and that Proteſtants are his forerunners,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>

But the Pope hath already reigned ſpiritually in the Church aboue 1500. yeares; and there cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſigned, who hath byn accompted Antichriſt, who hath raigned preciſely three yeares and a halfe.

                  <q>Now, that Antichriſts raigne ſhalbe three yeares and a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> halfe, it is gathered out of <hi>Dan. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. and <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. where we read, that Antichriſts raigne ſhall indure <hi>for a tyme, and tymes, and halfe a tyme:</hi> for by <hi>a tyme</hi> is vnderſtood one yeare, by <hi>tymes</hi> two yeares, and by <hi>halfe a tyme</hi> halfe a yeare.

               </p>
               <p>

The ſame ſaith <hi>Bullenger ſerm.</hi> 46. <hi>in Apoc.</hi> whoſe reaſon ſeemeth to be that, which <hi>Luther</hi> inſinuateth <hi>in ſupput. temporum,</hi> becauſe it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. that the Diuell is to be looſed in the thouſand yeare: wherfore the comming of Antichriſt with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſword was the thouſand yeare after Chriſt; therfore now he hath raigned more then fiue hundreth yeares: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt take thoſe 42. monthes for an vncertaine tyme.</q>
               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <q>Secondly it is proued, for that the Scriptures ſay, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> the tyme of the Diuel being looſed, and of Antichriſt, ſhalbe very ſhort, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. <hi>VVoe be to the earth, and the ſea, becauſe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill goeth downe to you, hauing great anger knowing that he hath a ſmall tyme.</hi> And <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. <hi>hee bound him for a thouſand yeares, and after this he muſt be looſed a ſmall tyme.</hi> How I pray you, ſhall this be true if Antichriſt ſhall raygne 1260. yeares?

               <p>
                  <q>Sixtely, becauſe when <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. wee often read, that 7. <hi>tymes shall paſſe</hi> in which <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> ſhalbe out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> by thoſe tymes all vnderſtand. 7. yeares, for if wee would vnderſtand yeares of yeares, as the aduerſaries vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, when Antichriſt is ſpoken of, wee ſhould ſaie, that <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> lyued out of his Kingdome 2555. yeares.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Neither is it hard to ſolue their ſlender reaſons; for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> when <hi>Chytraeus</hi> ſaith, that the three yeares and an halfe, of which <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>S.

                  <p>But yet <hi>M.

Chapter, <hi>there is no ſpeach of Antichriſt, but of the Diuel, who firſt ſeeketh to ouerthrow the Church of Chriſt among the Iewes, and afterward commeth to the Gentiles, and therfore it is ſaid, that he ſtandeth vpon the ſea shore, from whence he rayſeth the Beaſt with</hi> 7. <hi>heades &amp;c.</hi> where it is meruaile, that <note place="margin">

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not vnfitly Antichriſt is here called his taile, in which chiefly the venome of this ſerpent lyeth: ſo that whatſoeuer <note place="margin">The diuel and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p n="4">4. In the ſecond place <hi>M. Downam</hi> addeth, that by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> interpretation of thoſe tymes, it would follow, <hi>that after Antichriſt is once reuealed, all men that be acquainted with the Scriptures, may preciſely define before hand the very day of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto iudgment, which the Lord notwithſtanding will not haue knowne</hi> Mar. 13. 32. <hi>as Bellarmine himſelfe muſt needes graunt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he vſeth this, as the chiefe argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt thoſe who by</hi> 1260. <hi>daies</hi>

                     <hi>vnderſtand ſo many yeares.</hi> To which I anſwere that no ſuch thing can be gathered out of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who lately alſo <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. cap.</hi> 10. hath plainly declared, that in his opinion, there can no more be gathered out of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> then that the world ſhall endure at leaſt 45. dayes after Antichriſts death, but whether longer or no, that the Scripture decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not: but indeed <hi>S. Hierome</hi> wryteth plainly, that 45. dayes after Antichriſts death, Chriſt ſhall come to Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Out of which wee willingly graunt, that thoſe which liue, at the tyme of Antichriſts death may eaſilie ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Scripture, how far the day of iudgment is off. Neyther is this againſt <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. 32. where our Sauiour only ſaith, that at that tyme it was only knowne to God, which hindereth not, but that heerafter it may be gathered by <hi>Daniels</hi> propheſie, when it is within ſo few dayes.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>M. Downam</hi> addeth further in his 6. Chapter, that our <hi>Sauiour Matth.</hi> 24. 39. <hi>and Luc.</hi> 17. 26. <hi>hath foretould, that the end of the world shalbe ſuddaine, and vnlooked for euen as it was in the daies of Noah and Lot.</hi> This is the obiection which I referred to this place, as belonging to it, and <hi>Daniel</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it with a diſtinction, that at the death of Antichriſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15294:88"/> there ſhalbe both good and wicked men, as there were in the time of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Let,</hi> and euer ſince. Now ſaith <hi>Daniel,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Only the iuſt &amp; le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned ſhall make this collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                     <hi>impièagent impij, neque intelligent ownes impij: porrò docti. intelligent.</hi> the wicked ſhall doe wickedly, and none of them ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand (theſe myſteries, though they be ſo plainely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tould) and of theſe ſpeaketh our Sauiour when he ſaith, that the day of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhall come vnlooked for. But <hi>Daniel</hi> addeth further, <hi>porrò docti intelligent;</hi> the learned ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, and may make a certaine collection of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the daie of Iudgement, when they once ſee Antichriſt dead, that is, ſuch pious interpreters as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> was. And this difference wee ſee in the tyme of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and now alſo: for though the Scripture ſpeaketh plainly of Antichriſt and his perſecution, and how long it is to continue: yet wicked <hi>Porphyrie, M. Downam,</hi> and the reſt of that crew vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it not: but <hi>S. Hierome</hi> and other holy Saintes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes inſtructed by them vnderſtand it plainely. So true is, and euer was, and ſhalbe that ſaying of the Wiſeman, <hi>In maleuolam animam non introibit ſapientia.</hi> Wiſdome will not <note place="margin">Sap. 1.</note> enter into a wicked and malicious ſoule; ſuch as all hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes haue, and alway had, though they brag neuer ſo much of Scripture, and their priuate ſpirit, which is one of the chiefeſt branches of their impiety. Neither doth this any whit infring <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument againſt thoſe which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the 1260. daies to be ſo manie yeares: for they cannot haue any ground at all, to affirme that thoſe yeares are to <note place="margin">Downa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s iugling.</note> begin more at one tyme, then at another, and yet euery one by aſſigning what tyme it pleaſeth him, muſt needs graunt, that from that tyme vntill Chriſts comming there are iuſt ſo many yeares, which is, to take vpon them to know that, which Chriſt ſaid was ſo hydden, that without an euident reuelation, as that of <hi>Daniel</hi> is, after Antichriſts death, no man, nor Angell can know it. So that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vſeth that argument, only to diſprooue the tyme, which <hi>Illyricus</hi> and others appoint of Antichriſts comming, and not abſolutly to reproue that interpretation; as <hi>M. Downam</hi> would haue his reader think. Wherefore in all this Chapter, in which he ſo largelie refuteth that interpretation, he neuer vrgeth that illation. But this is no iugling at all in <hi>M. Downa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt.</p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:15294:89"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, ſaith <hi>M. Downa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, It is incredible, if not impoſſible, that ſo many and ſo great thinges, as they aſſigne to Antichriſt should be effected, and brought to paſſe in ſo short a tyme, as</hi> Hentenius <hi>a learned Papiſt doth confeſſe, and as hath bene shewed heretofore. If M. Downa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In praefat, tranſlat. Areth.</note> had ſet downe theſe many and great thinges wee might perhaps haue ſhewed him how many of them were not to be done in theſe 3. yeares and a halfe, in which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Antichriſt may doe very many by himſelfe, and his Miniſters, hauing all the world at command; and thus is <hi>Hentenius</hi> to be expounded, who only thinketh it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for Antichriſt to obtaine ſo many Kingdomes and Prouinces in ſo ſhort a ſpace: which maketh nothing at all againſt vs, who rather think, that this ſhort tyme is to begin after thoſe victoryes be ended. <hi>M. Downa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> other proofes are to be examined in their due places.</p>
                  <p>Fourthlie (ſaith <hi>M. Downa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) VVhen wee proued that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is not any one man alone, but a whole State and ſucceſſion of man, we proued this by conſequence, that his raigne was not to continue only three yeares and a halfe.</hi> He ſaith well: for when he can prooue the one, he may proue the other; but he will neuer be able to proue either, as the Reader will eaſily ſee, by conferring <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See chap.</hi> 2.</note> his proofes, and my anſweres togeather: which now it is no tyme nor place to do.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly (ſaith <hi>M. Downam) Antichriſt according to the conceipt of the Papiſts is to raigne before the preaching of the two witneſſes, and as</hi>

                     </hi> might haue done well to haue named thoſe Papiſts who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt Antichriſts raigne before the preaching of the two witneſſes, for we would haue byn ſo bould, as to haue tould them, that they were in a wrong conceipt, vnles they mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he ſhould be of great power before; but yet not of ſo great, as he ſhalbe for the ſpace of three yeares and a halfe, in which theſe two glorious wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſhall preach, as neither in his laſt moneth after their death, by which he ſhall receaue ſuch a blow, that his kingdome ſhalbe ſo much diminiſhed, that the laſt moneth

                        <hi>Supra nu.</hi> 2.</note> and theſe two holy witneſſes preaching. Laſtly he remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe to his proofes, that Antichriſt <hi>was come in the Apoſtles tyme, and reuealed in the yeare</hi> 670. for anſwere of which bare aſſertion (for heere he goeth not about to proue any thing) I muſt likewiſe remit my Reader to the anſwers <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See Chap.</hi> 3.</note> which I gaue to thoſe his proofes in their due places, and ſo leaue him to iudge how well <hi>M. Downam</hi> hath anſwered <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi> allegations, and confuted his aſſertions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. After <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had propoſed his owne argument <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV. V. VI.

                  <p>To <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d proofe <hi>M. Downam</hi> hath more to ſay: for firſt he reprehendeth <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> for ſaying, that the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/>

But <hi>M. Downa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> denieth this alſo, ſhewing at large, that many tymes a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeares or more <note place="margin">

Kinges, which went before him, which howſoeuer <hi>M. Downam</hi> vnderſtandeth them, cannot be ſaid to haue raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned much more then a thouſand yeares a peece. Neither is it true, that <hi>Antichriſt not only was, but alſo perſecuted thoſe, that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his marke, within the thouſand yeares of Sathans impriſonment:</hi> though <hi>S.

                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.</note> togeather with thoſe which were before; of which only he ſpeaketh, when he ſaith that they liued and raigned with Chriſt in the thouſand yeares: except ſome will ſay with <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> that the Martyrs in the tyme of Antichriſt are ſaid to raigne (before they were) in the former Martyrs, becauſe they were members of the ſame body: or that the thouſand yeares are diuerſly taken. And thus wee ſee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the tyme of Antichriſtes raigne, and the Diuells being looſe, is ſaid to be a very ſhort tyme.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To the third argument he anſwereth briefely, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/>

                        </gap>s,</hi> as he hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly prooued (if you will belieue him:) but if you will take a view of my anſwere to his proofes, perhaps you will thinke them manifeſtly fond and fooliſh. Secondly he ſaith, that <hi>wee are to diſtinguish betwixt the tyme of Antichriſts continuance, &amp; the tyme of his heateſt perſecution;</hi> which we willingly admit, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See chap.</hi> 4.</note> though ſo, that we alway thinke, that his whole perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhalbe moſt hoat: for we find no cold perſecution of his at all. Wherefore if he will graunt vs, that the great and hoat perſecution of Antichriſt, which is ſpoken of in the Scripture ſhalbe very ſhort, leaſt in a manner all periſh, we deſire no more; and thus much we muſt haue whether he will or no, ſince the Scripture truly interpreted by the holy Fathers expreſly affirmeth it.</p>
                  <p>In anſwering the fourth congruence, he is ſomewhat large. Firſt he ſaith, that <hi>Bellarmine preſuppoſeth that Antichriſt is but one man,</hi> which is true in ſome ſort, becauſe he had proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it before, and yet proueth it now againe thus farre, that it is very improbable, that more then one ſhould be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:15294:90"/> for the ſpace of 3. yeares and a halfe, longer then which Chriſt preached not; and therefore in likelihood Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhall preach no longer neither.</p>
                  <p>Secondly he taketh vp <hi>Bellarmine</hi> very ſhort, <hi>for making himſelf Gods Counſaylour:</hi> which yet is farre otherwiſe, for he only ſeeketh reaſons of that, which is already knowne that God hath done.

Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> he commeth to the 1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 2. where he impugneth the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.</note> argument that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> frameth out <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> making him prooue, that it is now the laſt houre, becauſe wee ſee many petite Antichriſts. For, ſaith <hi>M. Downam,</hi> by the like reaſon <hi>wee might prooue, that the fulnes of tyme was from the beginning, becauſe there were alway Prophets, which Bellarmine calleth the forerunners of Chriſt.</hi> But <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſhould haue conſidered, that it is not abſolutely true, that it is the fulnes of time, whenſoeuer it may be ſaid that Chriſt commeth, but only when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in perſon, and therfore it is no meruaile, though he commeth in his forerunners fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the world, <note place="margin">Antichriſt cannot be ſaid to come at al but in the laſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure.</note> and yet the fulnes of tyme was not come; but Antichriſt cannot be ſaid to come at all, but only in the laſt houre, and therfore <hi>S. Iohn</hi> proueth verie well, that it was the laſt houre, becauſe Antichriſt was already come in his members and forerunners.</p>
                  <p>After he hath thus checked <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for framing of <hi>S. Iohns</hi> argument, <hi>M. Downam</hi> taketh vpon him to put it in forme himſelfe. This then (in his opinion) is the Apoſtles reaſon. <hi>VVhen the Antichriſt commeth, it is the laſt houre. Now, ſaith he, Antichriſts are come (meaning by Antichriſts, the ſame with the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, which elswhere he affirmeth was then entred into the world, or els there are</hi> 4. <hi>termini,</hi> 4. <hi>termes in the Apoſtles argument:) Therfore now is the laſt houre.</hi> But in this manner <hi>S.

                  <q>There are many opinions of this number.

                  <q>The 4. opinion is of <hi>Rupertus</hi> himſelfe, who thinketh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> that the name of Antichriſt is not ſignified by this number, but a triple preuarication of the Diuell to be fulfilled in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt: for the number of 6. becauſe it commeth not to 7. in which is reſt and happynes, is the number of a creature by preuarication falling from reſt. And the Diuell hath incurred a threefold preuarication, or rather hath tripled one. For firſt he preuaricated when he ſinned in himſelfe: after againe when he made the firſt man ſinne, and then to 6. he added 60. Thirdly he ſhall preuaricate, when he ſhall ſeduce the whole world by Antichriſt, and then to 60. he ſhall adde 600.</q>

                  <q>The fifth opinion is <hi>Bedes,</hi> who taketh the contrary courſe, and teacheth that the number of 6. is perfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> God made heauen and earth in 6. dayes, and 60. more perfect, and 600. moſt perfect. Whereupon he gathereth that Antichriſt is deſigned by the number 666. becauſe he ſhall vſurpe to himſelfe the moſt perfect tribute, which is only due to God. In figure wherof we read <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Reg. cap.</hi> 10. that the weight of gold which was brought euery yeare to <hi>Salomon</hi> was 666000. talents. Theſe two opinions ſeeme not ſufficiently to agree with that which <hi>S.

               <p>

               <p>
                  <q>We may alſo adde a third reaſon out of the ſame <hi>Irenaeus:</hi> for a little before diſputing againſt them, which gathered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> falſe names of Antichriſt, out of their owne conceipt, he ſaith, that they fall into many inconueniences, for they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues to the danger of erring, and of deceauing others, and of cauſing both themſelues and many others to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:15294:98"/> be moſt eaſily ſeduced by Antichriſt. For when he ſhall come, and haue another name then they perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues he ſhall haue, he ſhall not be held by them to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and conſequently ſhall not be auoyded. All which inconueniences will doubtles happen to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and eſpecially this laſt, for becauſe they haue perſwaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that the Pope is Antichriſt, when that true Antichriſt ſhall come, he will not eaſily be diſcerned by them, and therefore not auoyded.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But heere we muſt note, that Antichriſts name wilbe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> moſt manifeſt when he is come, for likewiſe before Chriſt came, the Iewes knew not certainely how he ſhould be called, although the Prophets had foretould many thinges of his name. Yea one of the <hi>Sybills</hi> (as we find in the firſt booke of their verſes) had noted the number of Chriſts name and ſaid that it was 888. as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> wrote of Antichriſt, that the number of his name is 666. And yet vntill Chriſts comming men knew not, that he was to be called Ieſus. But ſince Chriſts comming all controuerſy is taken away, and all know that he is called Ieſus.</q>

Downam</hi> ſhould haue conſidered, that <note place="margin">Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts name ſhal be known when he is come.</note> 
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaketh not of any ſecret comming of Antichriſt, but of his reuelation and raigne, which <hi>M. Downam</hi> and his crew affirme to haue happened many hundred yeares ſince, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confuteth them by this argument, that if it were ſo. Antichriſts name would be well knowne, as we ſee Chriſts is, and yet many are ſo mad, as to refuſe Chriſt, though they know his name: and in like manner no doubt, many will imbrace Antichriſt after that his name ſhalbe certaynely knowne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly <hi>M. Downam</hi> telleth vs, that <hi>in the ſimilitude taken from Chriſt there is no likeneſſe, becauſe Chriſt was ore particuler man, but Antichriſt is not, but a State which cannot haue a proper name:</hi> which as you ſee is no anſwere at all, if Antichriſt ſhalbe <note place="margin">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:15294:99"/> which I remit my Reader: and beſides I ſee no reaſon why a State may not haue a proper name alſo. Yet <hi>M. Downam</hi> giueth vs another difference, for that <hi>Chriſt comming to ſaue, his name Ieſus, the name of the Sauiour was to be made knowne, that he might the rather be imbraced: Antichriſt comming to deceaue, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">M. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nams iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> 
                     <hi>was (according to his diuellish policy) to conceale that name, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he should be knowne to be Antichriſt;</hi> where you muſt marke how cunningly <hi>M. Downam</hi> concealeth the diligence which the Diuell vſed to obſcure the name of Chriſt, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the power and wiſdome of God to make Antichriſt knowne, for otherwiſe his Reader would very eaſily haue conceyued how God is as able to manifeſt Antichriſts name, that he may be auoyded, as he was to make our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours name knowne, that he might be imbraced. And beſides it is more then probable, that Antichriſt will not be ſo humble, but that he will deſire to haue his name knowne: for this is the great and powerfull wiſdome of God to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the wicked by their owne courſes. Wherefore it is not certayn, that Antichriſt ſhall either know, or make accompt of this Propheſy, nor reflect vpon his name, whether it conteyneth this number or no. But though all this ſhould be ſo, yet he will thinke to ouercome this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, aſwell as the reſt, eſpecially when he is come to that height of pryde to extoll himſelfe aboue all that is called God. And ſure we are, that by one meanes or other his name ſhalbe manifeſt, for otherwiſe this reuelation of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> concerning it, would ſerue to ſmall purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>M. Downam</hi> maketh a litle digreſſion from his purpoſe to tell vs, <hi>that the Sybil did not only foretell, that our Sauiours name should conteyne the number</hi> 888. <hi>but alſo, by certayne Acroſtiches foretould that he should be Ieſus Chriſt, the ſonne of God and Sauieur But of Antichriſt she ſpeaketh nothing ſo playnly: howbeit she calleth Rome Babylon as Io. doth.

                     <hi>M.

As for <hi>M.

Wherefore all <hi>Irenaus</hi> his proofes are good and firme for the end that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth them, as likewiſe his inference is euident to all Catholikes, that <note place="margin">The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</note> the Proteſtants are in great danger to receaue Antichriſt when he commeth, ſince before he come they ſo verily perſwade themſelues that he is already come, which is a good warning for Proteſtants alſo to looke about them, and to take heed, that they be not ſo confident, but vpon better groundes, for the daunger is great. But heere I muſt deſire my Reader to marke attentiuely <hi>M. Downams</hi> deuiſe, who will needes be ſo fooliſh as to ſeeme to thinke, that <note place="margin">M.

                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:15294:102"/> true proofe, which is, that Antichriſts name is not yet knowne, becauſe there is a great controuerſy about it.

For firſt about Antichriſts name, there is not only a queſtion betwixt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes and Proteſtants, but likewiſe euen Proteſtants <note place="margin">M.

And beſides <hi>M.

But heere it is otherwiſe; for though <hi>M.

But to come to our particuler, <hi>M.

But how can <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for not anſwering this argument, which <hi>M.

To which <hi>M. Downam</hi> giueth no other anſwere but this in theſe wordes: <hi>Neither ought it, ſeeing it is the name of the beaſt which ſignifieth a whole State,</hi> and in ſetting downe <hi>Bellarmines</hi> obiection he omitteth the one halfe, that it muſt be vſuall, only making mention of the other, that it muſt be proper. And as you ſee, his anſwere is as ſlender, ſtill running vpon that erroneous conceipt of his owne, that this is not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts name, but of the <hi>Roman</hi> State.</p>
                  <p>Finally <hi>Bellarmine</hi> obiecteth that there are innumerable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> names, which make the ſame number. To which <hi>M. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> after a little cauilling at ſome of the names, which <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> bringeth, anſwereth, that though it be ſo, yet <hi>none can be the name heere ſpoken of, vnleſſe alſo it be the name of the beaſt, that is the Latin or Roman State, and vnleſſe it be ſuch a name, as he, to whome all other notes of Antichriſt doe agree, cauſeth men to take vpon them;</hi> which is to harpe ſtill vpon the ſame ſtring, and to ſing the ſame ſong like a Cuckow; for this name belongeth to no other beaſt, but Antichriſt: and the other part is the mayne controuerſy, and therefore to aſſume it as a thing graunted, is <hi>petitio principij,</hi> a figure wherewith <hi>M. Downam</hi> is well acquaynted, and therefore chooſeth to make it his concluſion alſo, as the Reader may ſee, if he pleaſe, to whoſe iudgment I leaue it to conſider whether <hi>M. Downam</hi> hath anſwered <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument, or rather that it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather vnanſwerable and inuincible, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> deſerued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmeth.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are alſo (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine)</hi> two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> or three opinions of Antichriſts Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. The firſt is, of the heretikes of this tyme, who teach that the Character of Antichriſt is ſome ſigne of obedyence and coniunction with the B. of <hi>Rome</hi> yet they do not explicate after the ſame manner, what that ſigne is <hi>Hemicus Bullengerus ſcr.</hi> 61. <hi>in Apoc.</hi> will haue it to be the <hi>vnction of Chriſme,</hi> with which all Chriſtians that are obedient to the Pope are ſigned in their foreheads. <hi>Theodorus Bibliander in Chron. tab.</hi> 10. ſaith, that the Character of the Pope is the profeſſion of the Roman faith: ſo that he is not accompted a true Chriſtian, who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not, that he cleaueth to the Roman Church. <hi>Dauid Chytraeus</hi> beſides theſe two, addeth the Oath of Fidelity, which many are compelled to make to the Pope. Likewiſe the Preiſtly vnction, which is receaued in the crowne, and hand, and imprinteth, <hi>as the Papiſts call it</hi> (quoth hee) <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deleble Character.</hi> Finally to fall downe before Images, and conſecrated bread, and to be preſent at Maſſes of <hi>Requiem.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Neither are theſe thinges vnlike to thoſe which <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in Apoc.</hi> 13. do teach. But it is an eaſie matter to confute
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:15294:105"/> theſe toyes, both becauſe they agree not with the words of the Text, and alſo becauſe all theſe ſignes were in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church before that Antichriſt had appeared, in their opinion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Firſt therefore we haue out of the text, that the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> ſhalbe one, not many: for the Scripture alway ſpeaketh in the ſingular number, both of the Character, and of the name &amp; number of Antichriſt. Wherefore there ſhalbe one Character, likewiſe one proper name of Antichriſt, and one number of his name. Wherefore when our Aduerſaryes multiply ſo many Characters, they ſhew, that they know not which that is, of which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly, that Character ſhalbe common to all men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> in Antichriſts Kingdome, as is playne by thoſe words: <hi>He shall make all; little &amp; great, rich &amp; poore, free and bound to take his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi> But the Oath of obedyence and Prieſtly vnction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to few.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly, the Scripture declareth, that the Character <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> ſhalbe ſuch, that it may indifferently be carried in the right hand, or forehead, for ſo it ſaith: <hi>He shall make all men receyue his Character in their right hands, or foreheads.</hi> But none of thoſe thinges, which our aduerſaryes bring, is ſuch: That the vnction of Chriſme cannot be receyued in the right hand. The profeſſion of the Roman Faith, is neither in the hand nor forehead, but in the mouth by confeſſion, in the hart by faith. The Oath of Fidelity is taken with the hand and mouth, but can in no wyſe be carryed in the forehead. The Prieſtly vnction is neither receaued properly in the right hand, nor in the forehead, but vpon the head and fingers of both hands. Finally to be preſent at Maſſes for the dead, to kneele before Images, and the Euchariſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to the forehead or hand, but to the whole body, and chiefely to the knees.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fourthly the ſame Scripture ſaith, That in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> of Antichriſt no man ſhalbe permitted to buy and ſell, vnles he ſhew the Character, or the name, or the number of the name. But how many doe buy and ſell in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious of the Pope, who are not yet chriſmed, nor haue taken the Oath of fidelity, nor are Prieſts? Doe not many
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:15294:105"/> Iewes, euen in the very Citty of <hi>Rome</hi> where the Pope hath his Sea, negotiate publikely, buy and ſell, although they haue none of thoſe ſignes?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Let vs come to the other reaſon &amp; prooue that all theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> ſignes are elder then Antichriſt. Antichriſt by the opinion of our aduerſaryes came not before the yeare 606. but <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> lyued about the yeare 200. and yet maketh mention of Chriſme <hi>lib. de reſurrectione carnis. The flesh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is washed, that the ſoule may be clenſed: the flesh is annoynted, that the ſoule may be conſecrated. S. Cyprian</hi> liued about the yeare 250. and maketh mention of Chriſme <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 12. <hi>He muſt neceſſarily be an noynted</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who is baptized, that hauing receaued Chriſme</hi> (that is vnction) <hi>he may be the aunoynted of God, and haue in him the grace of Chriſt. S. Auguſtine</hi> lyued about the yeare 420. and yet he ſaith <hi>tract. in Ioan.</hi> 118. <hi>VVhat is it, that all know the ſigne of Chriſt, but the Croſſe of Chriſt? VVhich ſigne vnles it be applyed, either to the foreheads of the faithfull, or to the water with which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, or to the oyle with which they are Chriſmed, or to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with which they are nourished, none of theſe thinges is rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Likewiſe to cleaue to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was the ſigne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> and Character of a true Catholike man before the yeare of our Lord 606. <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> writeth <hi>epiſt.</hi> 162. of <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> who liued about the yeare 300. <hi>He needed not to care for the multytude of enemyes which conſpired againſt him, ſince he ſaw himſelfe vnited by communicatory letters to the Roman Church, in which the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of the Apoſtolicall chayre alway flourished, and to the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries from whence the Ghoſpell came into Africa.</hi> S. Ambroſe, who lyued about the yeare of our Lord 390. in orat. de obitu fratris ſui: <hi>He asked the Bishop</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if he agreed in doctrine with the Catholike Bishops, that is with the Roman Church.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Victor Vticenſis,</hi> who lyued about the yeare of our Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> 490. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de perſecut. Vandal.</hi> writeth, that an <hi>Arian</hi> Prieſt going about to perſwade the King not to put a Catholike to death, vſed theſe wordes: <hi>If thou putteſt him to death the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans will accompt him a Martyr.</hi> In which place, by the name of <hi>Romans,</hi> the Catholikes of <hi>Africa</hi> are deſigned, who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les are not called <hi>Romans</hi> by the <hi>Arians</hi> for any other cauſe, but for that they followed the Faith of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:15294:106"/> and not the misbeliefe of the <hi>Arians.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>We find the Oath of obedience made to the B. of <hi>Rome</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> in the tyme of <hi>S. Gregory lib.</hi> 10. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 31. and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the yeare 606. for <hi>S. Gregory</hi> lyued not ſo long.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Of Prieſtly vnction we haue the teſtimony of <hi>S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> 
                     <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> who liued about the yeare 380. in <hi>Apologet. ad Patrem ſuum,</hi> when he was made B. of <hi>Safimi. There came vpon me againe</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the vnction and ſpirit, and I haue new cauſe of mourning and ſadnes.</hi> In which place, he maketh mention of a double vnction, the one when he was made Prieſt, and the other then at his conſecrating Biſhop. Likewiſe <hi>orat.</hi> 1. <hi>de pace,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>S. Baſil,</hi> who being made Biſhop refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the exercize of that authority: <hi>Although he hath the ſpirit, and talents, and the care of a flock committed vnto him, and is annoynted with the oyle of Prieſthood and perfection, yet his VViſdome delayeth to take vpon him the Prelacy.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now for the Sacrifice for the dead, it ſhalbe ſufficient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> in this place to bring <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> teſtimony, who <hi>lib. de hareſ. cap.</hi> 53. ſaith. That it was the peculiar fancy of <hi>Aerius</hi> the Arch-Heretike, that we ought not to offer oblation for the dead.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Of the Adoration of Images, only <hi>S. Hierome</hi> who liued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> about the yeare 400. ſhall ſuffice. He, <hi>in vita Paulae,</hi> ſaith thus: <hi>Proſtrate before the Croſſe, she adored, as though she had ſeene our Lord vpon it.</hi> Finally of the adoration of the Euchariſt <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> may deſeruedly ſuffice, who <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Spiritu Sancto cap.</hi> 12. explicating that place, <hi>Adore his footeſtoole: Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by the footeſtoole is meant the earth, by the earth the flesh of Chriſt, which at this day alſo we adore in the myſteryes, and which the Apoſtles adored in our Lord Ieſus, as we haue ſaid before:</hi> which <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, almoſt in the ſame wordes <hi>in explicat. Pſal.</hi> 98.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Since therefore all theſe thinges, which our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIIII"/> will haue to be the Characters of Antichriſt, were vſed by the Catholike Church many yeares before Antichriſt was borne: it muſt needes follow, that either Antichriſt learned them of that Church (and to ſay this, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Antichriſt with Chriſt) or that none of theſe things belong to the Characters of Antichriſt. And this is that,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:15294:106"/> which we prooue. Thus much ſhall ſuffice for this raſh and moſt abſurd opinion of our Aduerſaries, which they haue not proued by any witneſſes, or reaſons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſecond opinion is of certaine Catholikes, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> thinke, that Antichriſts Character is the letters with which his name ſhalbe written. So thinke <hi>Primaſius, Beda,</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertus,</hi> who ſeeme to be deceaued, becauſe they read, <hi>But he who hath the Character of the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name.</hi> But <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſaith not ſo, but thus, <hi>But he who hath the Character, or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name,</hi> and the Greeke text agreeth with this, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The third opinion is of <hi>S. Hippolytus</hi> Martyr <hi>orat. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummatione</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> 
                     <hi>mundi,</hi> &amp; ſome others, that the Beaſtes Character ſhalbe not to vſe the ſigne of the Croſſe, but rather to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate and aboliſh it. In which the <hi>Caluiniſtes</hi> are egregious forerunners of Antichriſt. I rather thinke that Antichriſt ſhall inuent a poſitiue Character alſo, as Chriſt hath the ſigne of the Croſſe knowne to all: but it is not knowne what this Character is, vntill Antichriſt commeth, as we ſaid of the Name.</q>

               <div type="refutation">
                  <head>M. Dovvnams Anſvvere confuted.</head>
                  <p>1. THOVGH <hi>Bellarmine</hi> frame no particuler argument from this diſcourſe of Antichriſts Character, yet <hi>M. Downam</hi> will needes by <hi>reſoluing the diſcourſe it ſelfe, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it with the former Chapter,</hi> make him argue from the Character, as he did from the number of the name. About which we will not ſtriue with him, but rather ſuppoſing that this was <hi>Bellarmines</hi> mynd, we will examine the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he giueth to this argument, ſo framed by himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>2. And firſt he would deny that Antichriſts marke ſhalbe knowne at his comming, in the very ſame manner that he denyed before, that the number of his name ſhould be knowne. Wherefore for this point, I remit the Reader to that which hath bene ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>3. As alſo for the other, that this Character is not
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:15294:107"/> yet knowne, becauſe there is ſo much controuerſy about it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he only teacheth briefely that which he explicated more at large, about the number of his name, which we examined and confuted before.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let vs ſee, what he can ſay for the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> or Heretikes of this tyme, whoſe opinion <hi>Bellarmine</hi> impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: by which we ſhall alſo diſcouer, <hi>how much his explication helpeth them, and what abſurdity the opinion of Catholikes conteyneth.</hi> Which two points <hi>M. Downam</hi> thought good to touch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came to anſwere <hi>Bellarmines</hi> two proofes.</p>
                  <p>4. And firſt to that out of the Scripture, <hi>M. Downam</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> granteth, that the marke of Antichriſt <hi>is but one,</hi> meaning (as he explicateth himſelfe) <hi>in ſubſtance, although the ſame by diuers</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The mark or Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Antichriſt but one.</note> 
                     <hi>meanes, may be diuerſly expreſſed and teſtified, that is, ſubiection to the Pope as their head, and the acknowledgment of the Sea of Rome, and of the Popes Supremacy</hi> &amp;c. But what he meaneth by <hi>one in ſubſtance,</hi> is not eaſy to conceaue, except it be this, that all the outward ſignes, Characters, and markes agree in this, that they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the ſame ſubiection to the Pope &amp;c. ſo that the markes ſhalbe diſtinct, and diuers in themſelues, and in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſignification, though the thing by them ſignified be one. But this is not ſufficient to affirme, that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Antichriſt is but one, for in this ſort the name, and the number of the name, and the Charcter are all one in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſince they ſignify the ſame thing; and all ſignes which ſignify the ſame thing may be ſaid to be one in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as wryting, ſpeach, geſture, and the like: and all the figures in the old Teſtament, which ſignified Chriſt are but one figure in ſubſtance, and all the Sacraments of the Church which ſignify grace, ſhalbe but one Sacrament, which is too great an abſurdity for <hi>M. Downam</hi> to defend, &amp; conſequently he muſt needes graunt, that his fellow Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers aſſigne more Characters then one, contrary to the Scripture, and therefore they are ſo farre from truly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the Scripture, that they wholy peruert it.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſecond inſtance, out of the Scripture, <hi>M.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> 
                     <hi>Downam</hi> giueth no direct anſwere at all, but would ſame put it off, by telling vs, that the Pope hath declared, <hi>that it is neceſſary to ſaluation,</hi> to be ſubiect to the Pope. But this is on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:15294:107"/> to ſhew, that the body muſt be vnited with the head, in which all Religions whatſoeuer, yea all Societies muſt <note place="margin">The mark of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all in his King dome.</note> needes agree. But <hi>Bellarmines</hi> inſtance impugneth two of the markes, which ſome Proteſtants affirme to be the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Antichriſt, by this euident proofe, that the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Antichriſt ſhalbe common to all men in Antichriſts Kingdome as the Scripture plainely affirmeth: but the oath of Obedience, and the Prieſtly vnction agree to few, therefore theſe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be the Character wherof the Scripture ſpeaketh. To this <hi>M. Downam</hi> anſwereth not a word, neither indeed could he, for euery part and parcel is moſt euident and playne, and therefore he was inforced to run to his old ſhift, and to bring vs his wonted figure of <hi>petitio principij,</hi> by which he deſireth vs to graunt him his concluſion, that the Pope is Antichriſt, without any further proofe. But he muſt pardon vs, becauſe it importeth vs much to hould with Chriſt, which we cannot ſee how we can poſſibly doe, if we oppoſe our ſelues againſt his ſubſtitute and Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as though he were Antichriſt, as <hi>M.

                  <p>To the third inſtance, <hi>M.

                     <note place="margin">Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts Character may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried either in the right hand or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</note> 
                     <hi>hand.</hi> But by <hi>M. Downams</hi> leaue, the Scripture mentioneth both the <hi>forehead</hi> and the <hi>right hand,</hi> &amp; that with diſiunction, that all muſt haue the marke in the one or in the other: by which it is plaine, that either of them will ſerue: ſo that it is indifferent to Antichriſt in which of them his marke be carryed, ſo that it be carried in the one of them: for that it muſt be carryed, is euident by the Scripture euen according to <hi>M. Downams</hi> tranſlation, which is this: <hi>That he may giue them a marke on their right hand, or els on their foreheads.</hi> For ſurely if he giue them a marke on either place, they muſt carry it perforce. Now as for his Myſticall interpretation, that they ſhall <hi>receaue this marke on their forehead by profeſſion, or in the right</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">This Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or practiſe.</note> 
                     <hi>hand by practize and operation:</hi> firſt it is hard to vnderſtand, how profeſſion is made with the forehead, except there be ſome marke vpon the forehead, and it will be no very eaſy matter for Antichriſts Miniſters to examine euery man that

Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth himſelfe.</note> marke. Finally <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſeemeth to contradict himſelfe: for on the one ſide he will haue profeſſion and practiſe to anſwere to the forehead and hand, and conſequently to be the marke, and yet a little after he ſaith, that the ſubiection it ſelfe is the marke, which is not only contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but alſo fooliſh: ſince that this ſubiection is the thing ſignified by the marke, and not the marke it ſelfe. For what wiſe man would euer ſay, that ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a ſigne or marke, but rather that other things are ſignes and markes of it, as appeareth plainly to any, that will conſider the ſubiection of ſeruantes to their Maiſters, ſubiects to their Prince, and of Chriſtians to Chriſt and God &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth inſtance <hi>M. Downams</hi> anſwere is, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> ſhall prohibite all Chriſtians, that haue not his marke to buy or ſell &amp;c. but he will <hi>permit the Iewes</hi> &amp;c. But we find no ſuch exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Scripture, which generally affirmeth, that he ſhall not permit any, <hi>little or great, rich or poore, free or bound,</hi> vnder which diuiſions, no doubt, not only the whole nation of the Iewes, but euen euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Iew is comprehended. And beſides, we find no ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in the Pope towards <hi>M. Downams</hi> Chriſtians: for though that Bull of <hi>Martinus Quintus</hi> had ben generall for all <note place="margin">The Bull of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus Quintus againſt the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites.</note> tymes and places, as it was not, yet doth it not exact that euery man ſhould profeſſe by word or worke his ſubiection to the Pope, before he be admitted to buy or fell any thing at all, eſpecially ſuch things as are neceſſary for daily ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but only excludeth all <hi>Huſſites</hi> &amp;c. from all human conuerſation (when voility or deceſſity, or ſome other law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full circumſtance doth not otherwiſe require) which are openly, manifeſtly, and notoriouſly ſuch: which is farre
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:15294:108"/> leſſe rigour, then Antichriſt ſhall vſe, and yet much more then we ſee vſed in many Countries now, euen by <hi>Martinus Quintus</hi> his authority, where Catholikes and Heretikes are permitted to liue peaceably togeather. Yea euen in <hi>Italy</hi> &amp; <hi>Spayne,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, where they are moſt carefull to auoyd this contagion, there is no ſuch rigour vſed as <hi>M. Downam</hi>

But though all this be true, yet we muſt not omit to obſerue, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this inſtance only impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth three of the markes, which <hi>M. Downams</hi> brethren aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, viz. <hi>Chriſme,</hi> the Oath of <hi>Fidelity,</hi> and <hi>Preiſthood.</hi> All which three, it is euident, that not only all Iewes, but likewiſe very many Chriſtians, yea Catholikes alſo haue not, and yet are permitted to buy and ſell: neither are they once queſtioned withall about any of them. All which <hi>M. Downam</hi> could not chooſe but ſee, though becauſe he could find no ſolution for <hi>Bellarmines</hi> inſtance thus lymited, he thought beſt to runne to generalityes, where he might roue a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>M. Downam</hi> hauing this diſpatched the firſt argument <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> commeth to the ſecond; where firſt he affirmeth, that <hi>though thoſe things had bene vſed in the Catholike Church before the reuelation of Antichriſt, yet that hindereth not, but that now they may appertayne to the marke of the beaſt,</hi> becauſe he doubteth not to affirme <hi>that there were many corruptions crept into the Church before the reuealing of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, which he was to retayne with increaſe.</hi> So that as you ſee, the marke of Antichriſt was in the world before himſelfe, yea in the Catholike Church, which conſequently muſt <note place="margin">The Church of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue the marke of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</note> needes belong to Antichriſt, and be a great freind of his, as indeed ſhe is to the Pope, and euer was, and wilbe as to her chiefe Paſtour vpon earth. But how ſhe ſhould beare and vniuerſally imbrace any marke or corruption of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, ſeemeth as vnpoſſible, as that Chriſt and Antichriſt ſhall haue both one marke, or one Church, and therefore <hi>M. Downam</hi> muſt either perſwade vs, that euen from the Apoſtles tymes the Church of Chriſt bare Antichriſts marke, and conſequently that he was then come, or els he
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:15294:109"/> muſt graunt, that his brethren haue not rightely aſſigned the markes of Antichriſt, but rather haue vttered an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">M. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nams blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</note> blaſphemy, charging Chriſts Church, and conſequently Chriſt himſelfe (who teacheth his Church) with the markes and doctrine of Antichriſt. But <hi>M. Downam</hi> giueth vs two differences, betwixt theſe markes before Antichriſts comming and after. Firſt <hi>vntill the yeare</hi> 607. <hi>there was not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the Catholike Church an vniuerſall ſubiection to the Pope as the head,</hi> and conſequently till then, <hi>theſe things could not be vſed as ſignes thereof, as ſince they haue.</hi> But <hi>M. Downam</hi> may when it pleaſeth him, take the paines to peruſe what <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The Church was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Pope.</note> bringeth in the 19. &amp; laſt Chapter of his ſecond booke concerning this point, &amp; I doubt not, but he will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge an vniuerſall ſubiection to the Pope euen from the Apoſtles; or if he be obſtinate, and will nor yield to an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent truth, yet I am ſure, he will neuer be able to anſwere <hi>Bellarmines</hi> proofes; &amp; if his pryde be ſuch that he preſumeth that he can; let him begin, when he will, and ſee what he ſhall gaine by it. The ſecond difference which <hi>M. Downam</hi> alleadgeth is, that before the yeare 607. theſe thinges <hi>were not impoſed and inioyned vpon all by the lawes of the Pope as ſince they are; ſo that the cauſe of vſing them now is not the example of the ancient Church, but the authority of the Popes law.</hi> But this is a very poore diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and argueth a wonderfull corruption in the ancient Church, ſince that ſhe was ſo forward to take Antichriſts markes, that ſhe needed no commaund: and beſides, if <hi>M.</hi>

                     <hi>Downam</hi> will take the paines to peruſe the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Councells, and Decrees of Popes, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth in theſe particuler controuerſies, he ſhall find, that there was the ſame neceſſity for all men to performe theſe things then, that there is now, many of them being commaunded by Gods law, and others not exacted of all, and ſome not of any, as the Reader may eaſily diſtinguiſh by conſidering the particulers.</p>

                     <hi>Chriſme</hi> he anſwereth, that <hi>thoſe three Fathers ſpeake of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting with oyle vſed in the Sacrament of Baptiſme;</hi> and addeth, <hi>that this alſo without warrant of the Scripture is retayned among the Papiſts.</hi>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:15294:109"/> Where you ſee he maketh theſe three Fathers Papiſts in that point at the leaſt: and though it be true, that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Cerimony of Baptiſme; yet in theſe places, they ſpeake moſt plainely of Chriſme, and the Sacrament of Confirmation. For <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now whether this vnction were vſed <hi>in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church,</hi> or no, is a new queſtion belonging to another place, and it is inough for vs now, that it was long before Antichriſt came, according to the Proteſtants accompt: and that they do not <hi>much vſe euen the impoſition of hands,</hi> which they acknowledg was vſed in the primityue Church: of which <hi>M.

I omit his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impertinent obiections out of the Canon law, where firſt that holy Pope and Martyr <hi>Melchiades</hi> ſaith, that a man <hi>shall neuer be a Chriſtian</hi> (meaning a ſtrong and valiant, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Chriſtian) except he firſt receaue this Sacrament: for ſo he vſeth the name <hi>(Chriſtianus)</hi> as the <hi>Latins</hi> vſe <hi>(Vir)</hi> and the <hi>Aurelian</hi> Councell ſaith, that this Sacrament is more to <hi>be reuerenced, then Baptiſme,</hi> if we reſpect the perſon of him who miniſtreth it, becauſe he muſt of neceſſity be a Biſhop, <note place="margin">How Chriſme is more to be reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced then Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</note> and beſides this Sacrament ſuppoſeth, and in ſome ſort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth baptiſme, and in that reſpect is ſaid to be more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, then baptiſme by it ſelfe. And this is all that <hi>M. Downam</hi> can ſay for himſelfe, or againſt vs; for that which he addeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning <hi>the ordayning</hi> of the Sacrament, as though it were ordayned by the Church, and not by Chriſt, is a fond Chymera of his owne. For we affirme that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt, as all other Sacraments were: and beſides
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:15294:110"/> it is now from the purpoſe, ſince our whole queſtion is, whether this Sacrament were vſed before the yeare 607. which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath euidently conuinced that it was.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond obiection <hi>M. Downam</hi> anſwereth with a diſtinction; that to <hi>cleaue to the Roman Church in ancient tyme, was the note of a good Chriſtian, becauſe then that Church was Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call;</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII. IX."/> 
                     <hi>but now it is the marke of an Antichriſtian, becauſe now that Church is Apoſtaticall.</hi> Where you find him ſtill in the ſame fault of <hi>petitro principij.</hi> And beſides you ſee, he graunteth aſmuch as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would haue him, that in old tyme the cleauing to the Roman Church was ſo far from beeing the marke of Antichriſt, that it was the (chiefeſt) note to know a good Catholike Chriſtian, from a falſe and wicked heretike: and conſequently it is to be accompted ſo ſtill. For the heretikes in thoſe tymes could ſay as <hi>M. Downam</hi> doth, that the Roman Church was Apoſtaticall, but they were not able to proue it any more, then <hi>M. Downam</hi> is: and all good Catholikes were then, and are now certayne, that it can neuer be ſo, ſince Chriſt hath promiſed the contrary to <hi>S. Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſors. And beſides it is very ſtrange, that <note place="margin">Chriſt &amp; Antichriſt cannot haue both one marke</note> Chriſt and Antichriſt ſhould both haue one marke. And that the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which the old Fathers vſed againſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, ſhould come to be vſed by Antichriſt againſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes. But to theſe abſurdities muſt they needes fall, who call light darkenes, and darkenes light, as <hi>M. Downam</hi> and all heretikes doe. <hi>M. Downam</hi> goeth forward with his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and differences, affirming, that in ancient tymes, <hi>at other Churches did cleaue to the Church of Rome, ſo did the Church of Rome cleaue to them. Now it acknowledgeth no Church beſides it ſelfe.</hi> All which is falſe; for now alſo other Churches cleaue to the Church of Rome, as to their head; and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cleaueth to them as to her members; and it acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth many other particuler Churches beſides it ſelfe ſtill, though all ſubiect and ſubordinate to it as they were euer. <note place="margin">How the Church of Rome is vnited &amp; ſtandeth with other Churches.</note> And that which he addeth is a meere cauill; for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if we vnderſtand that particuler dioceſſe, is ſtill accompted but a part of the Catholike Church: and in this ſenſe, a man may ſtill be a good Chriſtian, although he be not of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And in ancient tymes, the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:15294:110"/> Church of <hi>Rome</hi> alone (that is the Church, of which the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the chiefe Paſtor) was accompted the Catholike Church. And conſequently that he that was not a member of that Church was not taken for a Catholike or true Chriſtian, as appeareth ſufficiently by the places, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> citeth, to which I will only adde one more out of <hi>S. Hierome</hi> in his Epiſtle to Pope <hi>Damaſus. I am vnited in Communion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to thy Bleſſednes, that is, to the Chayre of Peter. I know that the Church was built vpon that rock; whoſoeuer eateth the Lambe out of this houſe, is prophane: if any man be not in the Arke of Noe, he will perish in the deluge.

Downam</hi> compare the writing of any Catholike at this tyme, and ſee if they attribute more to the Pope or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this tyme, then <hi>S.

                  <p>8. To the third obiection <hi>M. Downam</hi> anſwereth, that the Oath which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleadgeth, <hi>is not an Oath of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>

Neither is it to the purpoſe, that now ſuch Oathes are more generall, and common; for this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> denieth not: and who ſeeth not that the exaction of Oaths may proceed vpon diuers occaſions?

And the like may be ſaid of ſome other clauſes more expreſly ſet downe in ſome other formes of oathes, according to the neceſſity of tymes, and the qualities of them, who are to ſweare. <hi>M.

                  <p>To the fourth, after a fit of rayling, <hi>M.

But <hi>M. Downam</hi> goeth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:15294:111"/> beyond <hi>Innocentius,</hi> for he only affirmeth that they, to whom he wrote, that is at the moſt, the Grecians of his tyme, were not wont to vſe this cerimony of annoynting: but that the Greeke Church had not vſed it before, <hi>Innocentius</hi> affirmeth not, and much leſſe, that they had reiected it as Iewiſh. Wherefore theſe are <hi>M. Downams</hi> additions, which we may bouldly reiect, ſince he hath no proofe for them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his figuratiue interpretation falleth to the ground, and we are to take the words of <hi>S.

                     <hi>Iewell,</hi> as ſufficiently anſwered by <hi>D. Harding) M. Downam</hi> anſwereth firſt, that the adoration, which holy <hi>S. Paula</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Images vſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the yeare 606.</note> vſed, was <hi>not a common practice, but peculiar to her.</hi> But we muſt intreate him to let her haue <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> company at leaſt, who commendeth this her deuotion. Secondly he ſaith, that it <hi>was not vſuall vnto her, but only at that tyme, and that place.</hi> But how will he prooue this? Was it not aſmuch to kiſſe the ſtone of the Sepulcher, and to licke the place where Chriſts body lay, as to kneele downe before the Croſſe? Thirdly he ſaith, that <hi>the did not worship the Croſſe as Papiſts doe, but falling before that Croſſe, worshiped Chriſt.</hi> Well then, will <hi>M. Downam</hi> be content to do aſmuch? We will only deſire thus much of him, that he will apply that outward reuerence to the Croſſe, becauſe it repreſenteth Chriſt, whome he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardely ſubmitteth himſelfe vnto, and adoreth. And ſo much it is plaine, that <hi>S. Paula</hi> did in this and her other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of kiſſing and licking the Sepulcher: and in this ſort <note place="margin">How La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Croſſe by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes.</note> only doe we attribute the <hi>worship of Latria</hi> to the Croſſe, ſo that the outward reuerence be exhibited to the Croſſe, as a thing belonging to Chriſt, to whome the inward ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is wholy and entirely giuen.</p>
                  <p>To the authority of <hi>S. Amborſe</hi> for the adoration of the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> he anſwereth, that Chriſt may <hi>be adored in</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIIII"/> 
                     <hi>his Sacraments;</hi> but the <hi>Sacrament is not to be adored.</hi> To which I <note place="margin">Adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt vſed before the yeare 606.</note> anſwere, that we adore the fleſh of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the Proteſtants will not allow of, but <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> doth, &amp; the Sacrament it ſelfe, that is, euen the forme of bread and wyne may be adored in that manner, that we haue explicated of the Croſſe, that is, as a thing belonging to Chriſt; but alway the inward ſubmiſſion and adoration is to be referred to the perſon of Chriſt, which muſt needes be in the Sacrament, ſince his body and humanity is there,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:15294:112"/> as <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> affirmeth. Now that which <hi>M. Downam</hi> addeth out of <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> in the ſame place, is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For we know very well, that our <hi>B. Lady</hi> is not to be adored with that adoration, which is due to the Holy Ghoſt and Chriſt, which is all that <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> there affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, as appeareth euidently euen by thoſe words which <hi>M. Downam</hi> alleadgeth. Finally his euaſion to the authority of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> is very friuolous, for he neuer goeth about to anſwere the words, but ſuppoſeth that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> would not affirme the reall preſence which yet his wordes muſt needes import, ſince he ſaith that <hi>we eate Chriſts flesh,</hi> and <hi>that no man eateth, but he firſt adoreth:</hi> which is the very ſame, that <hi>M. Downam</hi> will needes haue to be the marke of Antichriſt: ſo that if we will belieue him, all the Chriſtians in <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> tyme had the marke of Antichriſt: for which his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no doubt if <hi>M. Downam</hi> lyue to ſee Antichriſts raigne, he ſhall haue a good fee; and howſoeuer, he cannot goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded, ſince the Dragon to whom Antichriſt belongeth taketh a record of all ſuch worthy enterpryzes, that tend ſo highly to the aduancement of his Kingdome. God graunt that <hi>M. Downam</hi> may take a better courſe in time.</p>
                  <p>12. Thus we might conclude this Chapter, but that we will not omit to examine how <hi>M. Downam</hi> impugneth the Catholikes opinion in generall, for that they ſeeme to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>num.</hi> 3.</note> agree in this, that the Character is a viſible marke of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts name which notwithſtanding he might haue ſeene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> denied by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> prouing out of the Scripture that the marke of Antichriſt and his name, or the number of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> name are not all one. But indeed that which <hi>M. Downam</hi> chiefely impugneth is, that it ſhalbe viſible, and yet in this <note place="margin">
                        <hi>num.</hi> 2.</note> alſo he is deceyued. For <hi>S. Hippolytus</hi> Martyr thought, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſhould be a priuatiue ſigne, that is, the not vſing the ſigne of the Croſſe, which is the marke of Chriſt: for which <hi>M. Downam</hi> was ſo angrie with him, and with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> both that he calleth him a counterfaite Author, and chargeth the other with falſifying his teſtimony. But for <hi>S. Hippolytus, Euſebius l.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. and <hi>S. Hierome in Scriptoribus</hi> will anſwere, who recount many of his learned workes, and <hi>S. Hierome</hi> nameth this of Antichriſt. &amp; <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> the Martyr thought
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:15294:113"/> him a fit man to propoſe to learned <hi>Origen</hi> to imitate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now how <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath falſified his teſtimony, <hi>M. Downam</hi> doth not tell vs, nor we can imagine, except it be, for that illation of his, that in <hi>S. Hippolytus</hi> his iudgment, Proteſtants are notable forerunners of Antichriſt, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is moſt manifeſt, ſince they neither vſe themſelues, nor will ſuffer others by their good will, to vſe the ſigne of the Croſſe vpon their foreheads, or to carry the picture of it in their handes, or to haue it before their eyes, as the Chriſtians vſed in <hi>S. Hippolytus</hi> daies (who liued not 200. yeares after Chriſts Paſſion) and Catholikes vſe to this day.</p>
                  <p>But let vs ſee, how <hi>M. Downam</hi> impugneth thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike <note place="margin">Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts marke ſhalbe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</note> Authors, that thinke it ſhalbe a viſible marke: his firſt argument is, becauſe <hi>it is a groſſe thing to imagine, that Princes and Magiſtrates, and men of all ſortes would euer ſuffer themſelues to be branded, as it were with Antichriſts viſible marke.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that it were groſſe indeed to imagine ſo, if theſe Princes &amp;c. were not forced vnto it by danger of incurring otherwiſe ſome greater inconuenience, becauſe it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that all ſhalbe ſo far gone that they will glory in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts marke, though no doubt many will, and others will ſeem to do ſo, though in their harts they miſlike it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we to thinke, that Antichriſt ſhall want deuiſes how to do this without paine or deformity. But I would faine know, where <hi>M. Downam</hi> found this imagination of branding, for I cannot ſee why all Catholikes may not be vnderſtood to ſpeake only of ſuch a viſible marke, as the ſigne of the Croſſe, which is viſible inough, and yet we ſee no man branded with it. His ſecond Argument is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if this were Antichriſt, practize, <hi>euery man would be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne him.</hi> But what meaneth <hi>M. Downam</hi> by diſcerning. No doubt men ſhall diſcerne him to be an enemy of Chriſt, and the queſtion in thoſe daies wilbe, which of them is the true Chriſt, for he will affirme himſelfe not only to be the true Chriſt, but alſo will extoll himſelfe aboue all, that is called God. Thirdly <hi>M. Downam</hi> obiecteth the <hi>ordinary gloſſe,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Downam contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth him ſelfe.</note> 
                     <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and <hi>Lira,</hi> and referreth himſelfe to ſome places of Scripture: by all which he only ouerthroweth his owne aſſertion, that all Catholikes agree that Antichriſts marke
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:15294:113"/> ſhalbe ſuch a viſible ſigne, as he impugneth, ſince now he himſelfe hath found ſome who thinke otherwiſe: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this is a new confirmation, that this Character is yet vnknowne ſince that Authors are ſo deuided in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning it. Finally, ſo farre, as theſe Authors agree <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See part.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. §. 4.</note> with the heretikes or differ from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> they are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confuted by him, with the ſame arguments with which he impugned the heretikes themſelues. And as for the Scriptures we ſhall more commodiouſly diſcuſſe them in another place, where <hi>M. Downam</hi> vrgeth them ſomewhat more in particuler, for now he alleadgeth them only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and ſo we anſwere in generall, that though other places cannot without abſurdity be vnderſtood of viſible marks, yet that proueth not, but that this place is ſo to be vnderſtood, ſince no doubt, ſome markes may be viſible, and all circumſtances argue a viſible marke in this place, though we cannot in particuler certainely tell, what this marke ſhalbe, which is a plaine token, that Antichriſt is not yet come as <hi>M. Downam</hi> maketh <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to reaſon in this place, and he himſelfe demonſtrateth a little before, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to Antichriſt name, as we haue ſeene.</p>

Firſt then, there were in tymes paſt many errours of Antichriſt. The firſt, that Antichriſt ſhalbe borne of a Virgin by the worke of the Diuell, as Chriſt was borne of a Virgin by the worke of the holy Ghoſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This errour is reported by the Author of the Treatiſe of Antichriſt which goeth vnder <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> name in the end <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> of his 9. Tome, which ſeemeth probable to be made by <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus:</hi> certainely it is not <hi>S. Auguſtines.</hi> This is a manifeſt errour for it is only the worke of God (who can ſupply all efficient cauſes) to produce a man without the ſeed of man, becauſe he only is of infinite power and contayneth virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally all the perfection of crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ures. The Diuell who is a creature can indeed doe meruaylous workes by ſpeedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of actiue thinges to paſſiue, but he cannot ſupply the actiuity of cauſes. Wherfore <hi>S. Auguſtine ep.</hi> 3. <hi>ad Voluſian.</hi> ſaith, that to be borne of a Virgin was ſuch a miracle in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:15294:114"/> Chriſt, that there could not be a greater expected from God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Yet it were no errour to ſay, that Antichriſt ſhall be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> borne of the Diuell and a woman, in that ſort that ſome are ſaid to be borne of the Diuells, which we call <hi>Incubi:</hi> for though the Diuell cannot by himſelfe without the ſeed of man produce a man, yet he can in a body aſſumed in the forme of a woman, receaue the ſeed of man, and after in the forme of a man caſt that ſeed into a womans wombe &amp; ſo beget a child. This <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> teſtifieth <hi>lib.</hi> 15. <hi>de ciuitate Dei cap.</hi> 23. and addeth, that this hath ben proued by ſo great experience, that it may ſeeme madnes to go about to deny it ſtill.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſecond errour was of the bleſſed Martyr <hi>Hippolytus</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> who in <hi>orat. de conſummatione mundi</hi> teacheth, that Antichriſt ſhalbe the Diuell himſelfe, who ſhall aſſume falſe fleſh of a falſe Virgin: for as the word of God, who is truth it ſelfe, tooke true fleſh of a true Virgin; ſo <hi>S. Hippolytus</hi> thought it probable, that the Diuell who is the Father of lyes would faigne himſelfe to haue taken mans fleſh of a Virgin. This opinion is refuted, both becauſe 2. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. Antichriſt is called a man, as alſo becauſe the reſt of the Fathers with common conſent do write, that Antichriſt ſhalbe truly a man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The third errour is, that Antichriſt ſhalbe a true man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> indeed, but withall a Diuell by the incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Diuell, as Chriſt by his incarnation is God and man. This error is reported and confuted by <hi>S. Hierome in cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Dan. Beda in c.</hi> 13. <hi>Apoc.</hi> and <hi>S. Damaſeen l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 28.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Origen</hi> thought this opinion poſſible: for <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>in Ioan.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> he affirmed, that ſome Angells were truly incarnate, whom <hi>S. Hierome</hi> confuteth <hi>in praefat. in Malach. &amp; in cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Aggaei.</hi> And doubtleſſe it is erroneous, for no created, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently finite perſon can ſuſtayne two perfect natures as the Word of God who is infinite can. Neither is there any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy of this now among Deuines: for though ſome ſay that it doth altogeather imply a contradiction, others teach it doth not: vet all agree in this, that it cannot be done by the force of only a creature, as the Diuell is.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:15294:115"/>
               <p>
                  <q>The fourth errour is, that <hi>Nero</hi> ſhall riſe againe, and that he ſhalbe Antichriſt, or els that he liueth ſtill, and is ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> preſerued in his youthly vigour, and ſhall appeare in his tyme. <hi>Sulpitius lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ſacrae hiſt.</hi> inſinuateth this errour; yet <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>dial. de virt. S. Martini,</hi> he writeth plainely, that <hi>Nero</hi> ſhall not be Antichriſt himſelfe, but that he ſhall come with Antichriſt, and at length be ſlayne by Antichriſt. But becauſe all theſe thinges are ſaid without any reaſon, <hi>S. Aug. lib.</hi> 20. <hi>de ciu. Dei. cap.</hi> 19. deſeruedly calleth this opinion a meruaylous preſumption.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Beſides theſe errours, there are two probable opinions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> of the holy Fathers, of the generation of Antichriſt. The firſt is, that Antichriſt ſhalbe borne of an Harlot, and not of any lawfull matrimony. So teach <hi>S. Damaſcen lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 28. and ſome others. But ſince it cannot be proued by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, it is probable, but not certayne.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſecond opinion is, that Antichriſt ſhalbe borne of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> the Tribe of <hi>Dan:</hi> ſo affirme <hi>S. Irenaeus l.</hi> 5. <hi>S. Hippolytus Martyr orat. de mundi conſummat. S. Ambroſe l. de benedict. Patriarch. c.</hi> 7. <hi>S. Aug. quaeſt.</hi> 22. <hi>in Ioſue. S.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This opinion is very probable, for the authority of ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> many Fathers, and yet not altogeather certayne, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many of theſe Fathers do not ſay, that they know it, but inſinuate it to be probable; as alſo for that none of thoſe Scriptures do conuynce. For firſt <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. <hi>Iacob</hi> ſeemeth to ſpeake litterally of <hi>Sampſon</hi> when he ſaith: <hi>Let Dan be made a Snake in the way, an horned Serpent in the path: and let him byte the heeles of the horſe, that the ryder may fall backeward.</hi> For <hi>Sampſon</hi> was of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> and he was truly like a ſnake in the way to the <hi>Philiſtians,</hi> for he met them in euery place and vexed them. So <hi>S. Hierome</hi> expoundeth it <hi>in quaeſt. Hebr.</hi> and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:15294:115"/> ſurely <hi>Iacob</hi> ſeemeth to wiſh well to his Sonne, when he ſaith theſe wordes, and therefore not to foretell euill, but good.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And if it be allegorically applyed to Antichriſt, it can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> be but a probable argument, ſuch as is drawne out of myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſenſes. And without doubt <hi>Hieremie cap.</hi> 8. ſpeaketh not of Antichriſt, nor of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> but of <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> who was to come to ouerthrow <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> through the Country which was called <hi>Dan,</hi> as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> rightely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it vpon that place. Now why <hi>Dan</hi> is omitted <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7. is vnknowne, eſpecially ſince <hi>Ephraim</hi> alſo is omitted, whoſe Tribe is one of the greateſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Beſides theſe two probable aſſertions, there are other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> two moſt certaine: the one, that Antichriſt ſhall chiefly come for the Iewes, and ſhalbe receaued by them as the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</hi> The other that he ſhalbe borne of the Nation of the Iewes, and be circumciſed and obſerue the Sabboth at leaſt for a tyme. This is proued, firſt out of the Ghoſpell <hi>Ioan.</hi> 5. where our Lord ſaith to the Iewes: <hi>I came in the name of my Father, and you haue not receaued me: if another come in his owne name, him you will receaue.</hi> Which place that it ought to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Antichriſt we haue proued before <hi>cap.</hi> 2. Likewiſe out of the Apoſtle 2. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe they haue not receaued the charity of Truth, that they may be ſaued: therefore God shall ſend them the operation of Errour, that they may belieue a lye &amp;c. Caluin</hi> and other Heretikes in their Commentaries vpon theſe words expound this place of vs, who becauſe we haue not receaued their Ghoſpell, are ſuffered to be ſeduced by the Antichriſt of <hi>Rome.</hi> But firſt they bring forth no witneſſes, but we haue all the Interpreters of our ſide who expound it of the Iewes. See <hi>S. Ambroſe, S. Chryſoſtome, Theodoretus, Theophila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus, Oecumenius.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Beſides theſe, <hi>S. Hierome quaeſt.</hi> 11. <hi>ad Algaſiam,</hi> ſaith thus: <hi>Antichriſt shall doe all theſe thinges, not with power, but by the permiſſion</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> 
                     <hi>of God; for the Iewes, that becauſe they would not receaue the charity of Truth, that is the ſpirit of God by Chriſt, that receauing our Sauiour they may be ſaued; God shall ſend them, not the worker, but the worke or operation, that is, the fountayne of Errour, that they may belieue a lye</hi> &amp;c. And alſo without the Commentaries of ſo many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:15294:116"/> the thing it ſelfe ſpeaketh, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the Iewes: for he ſaith that Antichriſt is to be ſent to thoſe who would not receaue Chriſt. Now, who ought more, and would not receaue Chriſt then the Iewes? Where it is alſo to be noted, that the Apoſtle ſayd not, <hi>becauſe they will not receaue the Truth,</hi> but, <hi>becauſe they haue not receaued.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpeaketh of them who would not belieue when Chriſt and the Apoſtles preached. Now it is manifeſt, that in the Apoſtles tyme, the Gentills receaued the Ghoſpell with exceeding great deſire, and the Iewes would not receaue it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Moreouer, beſides <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>For without doubt Antichriſt ſhall firſt ioyne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> to thoſe who are ready to receaue him. But the Iewes are of this ſort who expect their Meſſias a temporall King, as Antichriſt ſhalbe. But the Chriſtians expect indeed Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, but with feare and terrour, not with ioy and deſire. Wherefore as Chriſt came firſt to the Iewes to whome he was promiſed, and of whome he was expected, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward drew the Gentills alſo vnto him. So alſo Antichriſt ſhall come firſt to the Iewes, of whome he is expected, and after by little and little, ſhall ſubiect all Nations vnto him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now that Antichriſt ſhalbe a Iew and circumciſed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> it is certaine, and deduced out of that which hath ben ſayd: for the Iewes would neuer receaue one that were no Iew, or that were vncircumciſed for their <hi>Meſsias.</hi> Yea becauſe the Iewes expect their <hi>Meſsias</hi> of the family of <hi>Dauid</hi> and the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> without doubt Antichriſt although he be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> will faigne himſelfe to be of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Secondly all the Ancients teach moſt cleerly, that Antichriſt ſhalbe a Iew, as thoſe 12. alleadged a little before, who ſay that he ſhalbe of the Tribe of <hi>Dan;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:15294:116"/> 
                     <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> who in 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. affirmeth that he ſhalbe circumciſed, and <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> who in <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Dan.</hi> ſaith that he ſhalbe borne of the people of the Iewes, and <hi>S. Martin apud Sulpit. l.</hi> 2. <hi>dial.</hi> that Antichriſt ſhall commaund that all be circumciſed, according to the law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and <hi>S.

Gregory</hi> who <hi>lib.</hi> 11. <hi>ep.</hi> 3. ſaith that Antichriſt ſhalbe a reuerencer of the Saboth and other Iewiſh Cerimonies. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Hence we haue a moſt euident demonſtration, that the Pope is not Antichriſt. For from the yeare 606. in which our Aduerſaryes ſay that Antichriſt came, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that no Pope was a Iew, neither by Nation nor by Religion, nor in any ſort. It is alſo manifeſt, that the Pope was neuer yet receaued by the Iewes for the <hi>Meſias,</hi> but contrary wiſe is accompted their enemy, and chiefe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecutor. Wherefore they in their daily prayers aske of God, that he will giue the Pope the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuing a good mind towards the Iewes, and that in his daies he will ſend the <hi>Meſsias, viz.</hi> that he may deliuer them out of the Popes power: and they call a Biſhop, as chiefly the Pope is, in the <hi>Syrian</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>Zanbon,</hi> which ſignifieth a Tayle, and is oppoſite to an head: for becauſe we call the Biſhop the <hi>Head</hi> of the people, they contrary wiſe call him the Tayle in reproach; ſo farre are they off from being ready to receaue the Pope for their <hi>Meſsias.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Finally <hi>Rab. Leui Gerſon cap.</hi> 7. and 11. <hi>Dan.</hi> expoundeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/> all thoſe thinges which are ſpoken of Antichriſt, of the Pope, whom alſo he calleth another <hi>Pharao,</hi> and oppoſeth him to the <hi>Meſsias</hi> which is to come.

                     <hi>that Antichriſt is but one ſingular perſon;</hi> which though it
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:15294:117"/> were trne, yet he did preſuppoſe nothing but what he had proued before, which I remit to the Readers iudgement. <note place="margin">Downams abſurdity.</note> But now indeed this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t preſuppoſeth no ſuch thing, but is of much moreforce, if we ſpeake of many then if we ſpeake only of one, for it is moſt euident, that neither all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> Popes ſince 607. were Iewes not that the Iewes haue recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them as their <hi>Meſsias:</hi> both which thinges ſhalbe veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Antichriſt, be he one man or many, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> moſt certainely proueth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly <hi>M. Downam</hi> noteth briefely three pointes out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I. II. III. IIII."/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V. VI. VII."/> of the errours which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reiecteth. Firſt his cunning in that he imitateth <hi>crafty tradeſmen, who being deſirous to vtter their bad wares at a good price, firſt shew thoſe that are worſe, that the naughtines of the worſe may comnend and ſet forth thoſe that be not ſo bad.</hi> But where <hi>M. Downam</hi> learnt this cunning, or of what tradeſmen I know not, except he meaneth thoſe of his owne profeſſion: but ſure I am that no tradeſman can deale more plainely and ſincerely, then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth, telling vs what wares are ſo bad, that by no meanes they are to be delt withall. Againe what wares are likely to be very good, <note place="margin">Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> but yet ſome doubt may be made of them, which he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and vrgeth to the vttermoſt. Finally what they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that are out of all queſtion, being generally warranted by all the moſt skilfull and honeſt Merchants. This is <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> proceding in this, and all other difficulties, as the Reader may eaſily perceaue by peruſing his workes, and in particuler this place. Now, how this can be diſliked by any good and ſubſtantiall chapman, I cannot imagine; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome crafty and deceiptfull Merchant may be hindered thereby to vtter his broken traſh, and therefore out of enuy cauill at him, as <hi>M. Downam</hi> doth. His ſecond note is, that <hi>S. Hippolytus</hi> is the Father of one of theſe errors: <hi>vpon whoſe counterfaite authority</hi> (ſaith <hi>M. Downam) the Papiſts in other points concerning this controuerſy do ſo muchrely.</hi> But it <hi>M. Downam</hi> had aſmuch wit, as he hath malice, he might haue noted out of this place in what manner we eſteeme the authority of any Father, though neuer ſo ancient or graue, <hi>viz.</hi> if he holdeth any thing againſt all the reſt, and againſt a plaine place of Scripture, in the interpretation of which all the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:15294:117"/> reſt agree, we altogeather reiect the authority of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If he affirmeth any thing without euident proofe, <note place="margin">How Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes eſteeme of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> in which the reſt are ſilent, and yet he hath probability for that he ſaith, we admit of his authority as probable: and this ſo much the more or leſſe, as we find more or fewer of his opinion, or that they affirme it with more certainty and reſolution, or bring better proofes for that they ſay. But yet ſo long as we find any controuerſy among the Fathers, or that they vary in their expoſitions of any place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, we hould it not altogeather certayne that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part affirme, except the matter be decided by the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and the other Paſtors of the Church to whome it doth belong to decyde and define ſuch controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. But when all the Fathers agree it were more then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhenes, yea plaine madneſſe to goe againſt the whole ſtreame of all antiquity either in opinions belonging to faith, or in the expoſition of the Scripture. And by this <hi>M. Downam</hi> may ſee, that though we eſteeme the authority of <hi>S. Hippoly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> much, yet it alone is no certayne ground of our Faith, though we are farre from reiecting him altogeather, or calling him counterfaite, as <hi>M. Downam</hi> doth, without any other reaſon then that he diſpleaſeth him, as commonly all other Fathers doe. <hi>M. Downams</hi> third obſeruation is, that <hi>theſe opinions</hi> (which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calleth errours) <hi>shew into what abſurdities men doe fall, when as they will needes be comparing Chriſt with Antichriſt, as the Papiſts in many things doe.</hi> But he ſhould haue added, that theſe abſurdityes fall out, when theſe compariſons are made without any ſound or ſufficient ground, which the Papiſts do not in any thing at all, as appeareth plainely by this whole Treatiſe, and may in part be gathered by this, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reiecteth thoſe conceipts that were only grounded vpon theſe ſimilitudes, becauſe they were only builded vpon them, and are repugnant to other former groundes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thus <hi>M. Downam</hi> paſſeth ouer the errors, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII. IX. X. XI."/> commeth to the two probable opinions, about which he liketh <hi>Bellarmines</hi> iudgement well inough, in that he thinketh <note place="margin">M. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nams iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling.</note> neither of them certain, but maketh no mention of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part in which he affirmeth that the latter is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:15294:118"/> for the authority of the Fathers. <hi>M. Downam</hi> liketh alſo ſo well of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> interpretation of the two firſt places of Scripture, that he would challeng them to be his owne, or at leaſt to belong to his fellows. For in the firſt he plainely ſaith, that <hi>Bellarmine anſwereth with them;</hi> and in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 8.</note> the ſecond he relateth it ſo cunningly, that if the Reader be not very wary, he will eaſily thinke, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> were againſt <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> and that <hi>M. Downam</hi> had found it out.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, <hi>M. Downam</hi> goeth againſt <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> affirming that the trybe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> is not left out, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the Tribe of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> in which I like his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very well, for indeed (as <hi>Ribera</hi> and others vpon this <note place="margin">The tribe of Eph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raim, not omitted. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7.</note> place, proue very well) the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> is in other places called the Tribe of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 27. <hi>Amos</hi> 5. and the reaſon is, becauſe though <hi>Ephraim</hi> were the yonger brother, yet he was preferred before <hi>Manaſſes</hi> the elder <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. But what hath <hi>M. Downam</hi> gained by this? Is not this rather a confirmation of the Fathers opinion, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt <note place="margin">M. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth himſelfe.</note> ſhalbe borne of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> ſince that only was omitted in this place? Yea but (ſaith <hi>M. Downam) Symeon is not mentioned in the bleſſing of Moyſes Deut.</hi> 33. no more then <hi>Dan</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> But he himſelfe confeſſeth, that <hi>Symeon is comprehended vnder Iuda,</hi> but that <hi>Dan</hi> is altogether omitted, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.</note> which as you ſee is a great difference. And beſides though <hi>Symeon</hi> were altogeather omitted alſo, the reaſon were to be found out and not put off with another difficulty. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Why Moyſes omitted Symeon in his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</note> there be two reaſons why he was not mentioned by <hi>Moyſes.</hi> Firſt becauſe that Tribe was not to haue any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler poſſeſſion diſtinct from the reſt in the land of Promiſe but only ſome ſmall portion among thoſe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> for which cauſe, as it ſeemeth <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Symeon</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended vnder <hi>Iuda</hi> in this place, to which we may adde that other obſeruation of <hi>S. Hierome in quaeſt. Hebr.</hi> that in proceſſe of tyme, the Tribe of <hi>Symeon</hi> was conſtrayned to goe into the deſert becauſe they had not poſſeſſion ſufficient for them, after they were multiplyed, which he proueth out of 1. <hi>Paral.</hi> 4.

Thirdly our difficulty is not now why any Tribe is omitted; but why rather the Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> then any other. And to this <hi>M.

Princes of the other 10. Tribes. And in the tyme of the <hi>Iudges</hi> almoſt in euery Chapter, there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the peoples falling to Idolatry without any particuler mention of <hi>Dan,</hi> and euen that particuler Idolatry <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iudic.</hi> 17. 18.</note> which <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſeemeth to ayme at, was not begun by the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> but by <hi>Michas</hi> of the mountayne of <hi>Ephraim</hi> from whome thoſe of <hi>Dan</hi> tooke perforce his idolls and Prieſt: which indeed was a great ſinne in them, but not the firſt, nor yet the greateſt, and therefore not a ſufficient reaſon why the Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> ſhould be omitted only in theſe two places, as <hi>M. Downam</hi> will needes affirme againſt the Fathers, but indeed proueth nothing at all againſt them. For ſuppoſe his reaſon were good, yet that is no hinderance, why the reaſon of the Fathers ſhould not be good alſo: for why might not this Tribe be omitted for both theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the latter which theſe Fathers bring be a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the former, which <hi>M. Downam</hi> alleadgeth? For ſince <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh of thoſe which ſhalbe ſaued of the Iewes in the tyme of Antichriſt, and only omitteth the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> of which he reckoneth none to be ſaued, is it
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:15294:119"/> not more then probable that the cauſe of this is, becauſe the Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> ſhall wholy giue themſelues to Antichriſt <note place="margin">Antichriſt ſhall be of the Tribe of Dan.</note> as to the head of their Tribe? And likewiſe ſince the chiefe reaſon why the Genealogyes of the Tribes are rehearſed, is becauſe Chriſt was to be borne of one of them, may it not be very well thought that in hatred of Antichriſt, which was to be of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> the Genealogy of that Tribe was omitted? though indeed this latter proueth no more of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> then of divers other Tribes, whoſe Genealogyes were alſo omitted in that place; and therefore no meruaile, though the Fathers made no inference out of this, as <hi>M. Downam</hi> and ſome of his friends not very wiſely doe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>M. Downam</hi> hauing thus agreed with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in not admitting the Fathers opinion in this point, though he differeth in this, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thinketh it very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their authority, which he doth not; he would by this preſident prooue, that they may lawfully reiect the <note place="margin">Downam impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth the Fathers authority.</note> Fathers authority in all other pointes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Antichriſt, when it ſeemeth to them the Fathers alleadge not the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures in their true ſenſe. But firſt <hi>M. Downom</hi> muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that an vniuerſall is not to be inferred from a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Secondly <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reiecteth not the authority of theſe Fathers, but admitteth their opinion as probable, which is aſmuch as they themſelues for the moſt part affirmed, and ſo indeed <hi>Bellarmine</hi> followed them ſo farre as they would haue him. Thirdly <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had the authority of ſome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for his expoſition of the two firſt places, and therefore he might well follow their opinion, eſpecially ſince moſt of the other did rather follow the myſticall, then the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall ſenſe. In the third place where he brought no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for himſelfe, <hi>M. Downam</hi> did rightely correct him, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing his inſtance to be very probable, though ſtill there remayneth ſome queſtion why <hi>Ephraim</hi> was not named as well as <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> but comprehended vnder the name of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> Fourthly therefore <hi>M. Downam</hi> hath no reaſon to reiect all the Fathers, when they agree without contradiction or doubt, nor to make himſelf wiſer then he is, to take vpon him to vnderſtand the Scripture better then they all; yea
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:15294:120"/> though their arguments out of the Scripture ſhould be only from the myſticall ſenſe, yet he may well aſſure himſelfe, that they would neuer be ſo reſolute, except they had ſome other good ground of diuine or Apoſtolicall tradition, known by them to haue ben taught by the Apoſtles, and from their tyme, from age to age conſerued in the Church: for which reaſon I alſo incline to thinke that it is in a manner certayne, that Antichriſt ſhalbe of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> ſince ſo many Fathers affirme it without contradiction of any.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But let vs paſſe ouer this argument as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth, making it only probable and not certayne, and come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> to thoſe others, that are moſt euident and certayne. Againſt which <hi>M.

                        <hi>See Cap.</hi> 13.</note> haue occaſion to treat afterward. Beſides ſaith he, <hi>Bellarmine confeſſeth, that Antichriſt shalbe the head of the Apoſtaſy, that is, backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding Chriſtians,</hi> Ergo, <hi>not of the Iewes.</hi> But <hi>M. Downam</hi> might eaſily haue conſidered, that Antichriſt may be the head of both, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmeth. After this he noteth that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhalbe <hi>head of the Roman State, and haue his Seate in Rome,</hi> which how true it is we ſhall ſee afterward. Now I would <note place="margin">

In which we will not ſtand with him; but now our queſtion is, whether the Iewes be included in theſe wordes or no, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith they are, and that chiefly: and this he proueth out of the Scripture it ſelfe.

To which <hi>M.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:15294:121"/> howſoeuer he expoundes it. So that vnleſſe we will ſtand to <hi>M. Downam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this out Sauiours words ſignify moſt exactely, if <hi>M. Downams</hi> commentary be taken away. And yet the matter is more cleere in the words, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vrgeth, in which there is no Participle in the Greeke, as in the places which <hi>M. Downam</hi> compareth, but the Verbe it ſelfe; which cannot well be vnderſtood, but of things truly paſt, as neither the Verbe in the future tenſe, but of thinges truly to come; and ſince the Apoſtle limitteth not that preter tenſe to any other tyme, as our Sauiour doth: it muſt be vnderſtood to ſignify that, which was paſt before the tyme of his writing. But <hi>M. Downam</hi> obiecteth further, that <hi>if Bellarmine will needes vrge the preter tenſe, as though the Apoſtle meant that Antichriſt should be receaued only of thoſe, who before that tyme had reiected the truth, he muſt withall hould, that Antichriſt shalbe receaued in the end of the world of thoſe who dyed aboue</hi> 1500. <hi>yeares ſince.</hi> But this is both a falſe, and friuolous obiection: falſe, becauſe it addeth the word <note place="margin">Downam falſifieth Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines wordes.</note> 
                     <hi>(only)</hi> which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath nor, for he neuer went about to prooue, that only the Iewes ſhould receaue Antichriſt, but that they ſhould receaue him: friuolous, becauſe the Apoſtle &amp; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alſo ſpeake of the Nation of the Iewes, and not of any particuler men, as is manifeſt to any that is not wilfully blinded with malice, of which number it grieueth me that <hi>M.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> firſt certaine poſition, he commeth to the ſecond, which is, that Antichriſt ſhall be a Iew: which <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:15294:122"/> proueth out of his former aſſertion, that the Iewes ſhall receaue Antichriſt, which they would neuer do, except he <note place="margin">Antichriſt ſhall be a Iew.</note> were a Iew. To which <hi>M. Downam</hi> anſwereth, that he hath <hi>ouerthrowne that former aſſertion:</hi> which how true it is, I remit to the Readers iudgment. Secondly he obiecteth, that <hi>the Herodians receaued Herod for their Meſsias,</hi> but he doth well not <note place="margin">The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodians.</note> to ſtand vpon this; for the ſolution is euident, for theſe <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodians</hi> were a few flattering Courtiers, &amp; now we ſpeake of the whole Nation of the Iewes, and chiefly of thoſe great Rabbynes who profeſſe ſo great knowledge in Scripture, which teacheth moſt euidently, that the Meſſias is to be of the Iewiſh nation, and the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> though for this ſecond, they cannot now much ſtriue, becauſe their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogies are ſo confounded: and ſo it will be no hard matter for Antichriſt to be taken for one of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> though indeed he be of the Tribe of <hi>Dan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the authority of the Fathers, he anſwereth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Downam reiecteth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> to his cuſtome, that <hi>they are not to be belieued in this point which hath no ground in the word of God,</hi> and ſtill he inſiſteth vpon <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reiecting the twelue Fathers which affirmed, that Antichriſt ſhould be of the Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> for the ſame reaſons. But he abuſeth both <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Fathers, as the Reader may eaſily ſee. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> for he reiecteth not the Fathers authority, but imbraceth it as very probable, which was as much as the moſt of them affirmed. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe he reiecteth them all in a thing, wherin they agree as certaine, which they would neuer do without ſome certaine ground either of Apoſtolicall tradition, or Scripture, and reaſon, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath ſufficiently explicated in his former aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>Finally <hi>M. Downam</hi> briefly paſſeth ouer the oppoſition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII. XVIII."/> which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſheweth that the Iewes haue againſt the Pope, becauſe he was aſhamed to ſee what Iewes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are in this behalfe: but yet he is content to take hold of their application, of the Propheſies of <hi>Daniel</hi> againſt the Pope, becauſe <hi>they are no parties,</hi> and therfore their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <note place="margin">The Iews oppoſite to the Pope.</note> 
                     <hi>may be ſome inducement,</hi> to thinke indeed that the Pope is Antichriſt: where I could wiſh the Reader to marke atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, the great connexion betwixt Iewes and Proteſtants
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:15294:123"/> in this point of impugning the Pope, though vpon diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent grounds. For if you examine a Iew, why he is ſo eager againſt the Pope, he will tell you, that it is, becauſe he hateth Chriſt himſelfe, and for his ſake all Chriſtians, but chiefly the Pope, who is the chiefe of them. Againe if you <note place="margin">How the Iewes and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts agree and differ in impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Pope.</note> poſe <hi>M. Downam</hi> with the ſame queſtion, why he cannot abide the Pope? He will tell you another tale, that it is, becauſe he loueth Chriſt and all true Chriſtians, to whome he thinketh the Pope and his adherents to be moſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. And is it not ſtrange, that theſe men ſhould ioyne in the expoſitions of Scripture? Yea that <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſhould take the Iew to be no party againſt the Pope, but an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent man, and therfore thinketh his expoſition fit to be ſome inducement to make men belieue his doctrine? Is it not too plaine, that <hi>M. Downam</hi> is in the high way to deny Chriſt, howſoeuer he proteſteth the contrary, ſince he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Pope, whome the Iewes only deteſt out of their malice to Chriſt himſelfe? True it is, that the conſequence is not ſo neceſſary from the hatred of the Pope to the hatred of Chriſt, as contrariwiſe, but yet he that is come ſo farre, as to hate Chriſts moſt principal ſeruant in the higheſt degree, and with vnplacable hatred, may eaſily be carried a ſtep further, except God giue him grace to turne back in time, which I moſt hartily wiſh for <hi>M.

                     </hi> ſaith: <hi>The king of pride is nigh, and (which is impious to be ſpoken) an army of Prieſts is prepared for him.</hi> Out of which words a double argument is drawne, one thus: <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is ſayd to forerun Antichriſt, becauſe he will be called the vniuerſall Biſhop; therfore he ſhall be Antichriſt, who in very deed ſhall make himſelfe the Vniuerſall Biſhop, and ſhall ſit in the Church, as the head of all.

By which arguments the heretikes thinke, that they eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhew, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is Antichriſt, ſince he ruleth at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſitteh in the Temple of God, and is called the vniuerſall Biſhop, and is the Prince of Prieſts.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Notwithſtanding the true opinion is, that <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>Firſt then I make this argument: Antichriſt ſhall ſit in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> the Church of Chriſt, and ſhall be accompted the Prince &amp; head of his Church, and ſhall haue Magiſtracy and offices in it, as <hi>Philippus Melanctonin apologia art.</hi> 6. <hi>confeſſ.

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:15294:124"/> themſelues alſo teach in the ſame places. Therfore the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ſitteth in the true Church of Chriſt, and is the Prince and head of his Church. But the Church of Chriſt can only be one, as Chriſt is one, as <hi>Caluin</hi> alſo teacheth <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Inſtit. cap.</hi> 1. §. 2. Therfore the <hi>Lutheram</hi> and <hi>Caluiniſts,</hi> and as many as are out of the Church which is vnder the Pope, are out of the true Church.</q>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Caluin</hi> ſaw this argument, and anſwered, that not ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> much the Church, as the ruines of the Church of Chriſt are ſeene vnder the Pope. For thus he ſpeaketh, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Inſtit. cap.</hi> 2. §. 11. <hi>As there remained in old tyme certaine peculiar prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues of the Church vnder the Iewes; ſo neither at theſe daies do we take from the Papiſts the ſteps of the Church, which the Lord would haue remaining among them of the diſſipation.</hi> And after: <hi>God hath wrought with his prouidence, that there should be alſo other remnants extant, leaſt the Church should wholy perish. And as buildings are often ſo throwne downe, that the foundations and ruines remaine, ſo he hath not ſuffered his Church to be either ſubuerted from the foundation, or quite throwne downe by Antichriſt, or els he would haue the building halfe ſaued from deſtruction.</hi> And againe §. 12. <hi>VVherfore hence it is manifeſt, that we deny not, that the Churches remayne euen vnder his Tyranny.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But this ſolution affoardeth vs two arguments. The firſt; if only the ruines of Chriſts Church remaine: then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> the Church of Chriſt is fallen. Wherfore the truth hath ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which ſayd <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>and the Gates of hell shall not preuaile againſt it.</hi> The other, the Church is fallen, and the Papiſts hold the ruines of it, and the foundation, yea the building it ſelfe halfe throwne downe: Then the <hi>Lutheram</hi> and <hi>Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> haue no Church, for they haue not the whole and entire Church of Chriſt, for that is fallen, and the ruines yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine; neither haue they it halfe throwne downe, for that is among the Papiſts vnder Antichriſt. What haue they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Perhaps a new building, but in that it is new, it is not Chriſts. And who that is not altogeather blind ſeeth not, that it is more ſafe to remaine in the true Church of Chriſt, although halfe throwne downe, then in none?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now I come to the Scriptures, by which it is proued, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> that <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and not <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be the ſeat of Antichriſt. The firſt is <hi>in Cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Apos.</hi> where <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſaith: That <hi>Enoch</hi>

                  </q>

               <p>

                     <hi>Rome,</hi> letteth paſſe thoſe words (where alſo their Lord was crucified) as though they were not to the purpoſe. Neither is it any hindrance, that <hi>S.

For that earthly <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> may be called <hi>Sodome,</hi> for laſt and offences of the Iewes, is manifeſt out of <hi>Iſaias,</hi> who in his firſt Chapter, when he had prefixed the title: <hi>The viſion of Iſaias, which he ſaw vpon Iuda and Hieruſalem,</hi> addeth forthwith: <hi>Heare the word of our Lord you Princes of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, harken with your eares the law of my God you people of Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha.</hi>

                  <q>Now let vs anſwere to the arguments of our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which we propoſed before. To the firſt I anſwere in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/> three manners. Firſt it may be ſayd with <hi>S. Auguſtine in Pſal.</hi> 26. <hi>Arethas, Haymo, Bede,</hi> and <hi>Rupert. in cap.</hi> 17. <hi>Apoc.</hi> that by the Harlot, which ſitteth vpon ſeauen hills, and hath her Kingdome ouer the Kings of the earth, <hi>Rome</hi> is not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but the whole Citty of the Diuel, which in the Scripture is often called <hi>Babylen,</hi> and is oppoſed to the Citty of God, that is, to the Church, which is called <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and that by the ſeauen hils is vnderſtood the vniuerſality of the proud, and chiefly of the Kings of the earth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly it may be ſayd, and in my iudgment better, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/> that by the harlot is vnderſtood <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Tertull. l. cont. Indaeos &amp; lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cont. Martian.</hi> and <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And ſurely meruailous is the impudency of Heretikes who to proue that the Roman Church is the purple Harlot, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIV"/> vſe the teſtimony of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>S. Hierome;</hi> for ſince at that time <hi>Heathen Rome</hi> was contrary to <hi>Chriſtian Rome,</hi> which of them I pray you, do thoſe Fathers call the purple Harlot? If heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> why then do the Heretikes abuſe their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies? If Chriſtian <hi>Rome,</hi> it followeth that the Roman Church had degenerated then, and Antichriſt did raigne then, which they themſelues do not graunt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Furthermore if Chriſtian <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Babylon</hi> then, why <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXV"/> doth <hi>Tertullian de praeſcript.</hi> ſay: <hi>Happy Church to which the Apoſtles powred out their whole doctrine with their bloud?</hi> And why doth <hi>S. Hierome lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cont. Iouinianum</hi> in the end ſpeaking to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſay: <hi>Shall I ſpeake to thee, who haſt wiped away the blaſphemy written in thy forehead, with the confeſſion of Chriſt?</hi> Finally the ſame is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt out of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> himſelfe, who ſaith, that he ſpeaketh of that <hi>Rome,</hi> who held the Empire <hi>ouer the Kings of the earth, and which was drunke with the bloud of Saints, and with the bloud of the Martyrs of Ieſus,</hi> which certainly haue not place, but in that <hi>Rome,</hi> which in the raigne of <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> ſlew the Martyrs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly I ſay, although that Woman were Chriſtian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVI"/>

                     <hi>Rome,</hi> as the heretikes would haue it, yet their argument hath no force at all: for as we ſhewed before, Antichriſt <hi>shall hate Rome,</hi> and fight with it, and conſume and burne it, out of which it manifeſtly followeth, that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall not be the ſeate of Antichriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To the ſecond we haue already ſaid, that <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <q>To that of <hi>Daniel</hi> I anſwere, that eyther <hi>Daniel</hi> would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVIII"/> ſay, that the Temple is not to be built againe, but in the end of the world, which is true, for Antichriſt ſhall not come but in the end of the world, or that the deſolation ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for euer, becauſe though it were built againe, yet the Temple ſhould neuer be but prophaned after the ouerthrow made by <hi>Titus:</hi> for when it ſhall be erected by Antichriſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chiefly ſhall the abhomination of deſolation remaine in it, that is Antichriſt himſelfe, or his Image: or finally, that the Temple ſhould neuer be perfectly built againe, but yet that the building ſhould be begun, &amp; that Antichriſt ſhould ſit in the Temple begun in ſome ſort.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To the places of the Fathers we haue already anſwered, that they affirme, or at leaſt deny not, that Antichriſt ſhall ſit, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIX"/> in the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and wheras many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> add, that Antichriſt ſhall alſo ſit in the Churches of Chriſtians, it is true, and not contrary to vs, for the Fathers meane not that Antichriſt ſhall ſit in the Church as a Bishop, as Heretikes dreame, but that he ſhall ſit as God. For Antichriſt ſhall command that all the Temples of the whole world be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:15294:128"/> to his worſhip, and he will make himſelfe to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in them. <hi>He will command</hi> (ſaith <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To the arguments taken out of the words of <hi>S. Gregory</hi> I anſwere, that out of his words the contrary of that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXX"/> which the heretikes infer, for they argue thus: The Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did forerun Antichriſt, becauſe he made himſelfe the <hi>Vniuerſall Bishop,</hi> therefore Antichriſt ſhall be ſome <hi>Vniuerſall Bishop,</hi> who ſhall vſurpe all to himſelfe. But the contrary is inferred, for the forerunner is not to be the ſame with him whome he forerunneth, but farre leſſe, though like him in ſome thing, as appeareth in <hi>S. Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> and Chriſt. If therfore the forerunner of Antichriſt be he, who maketh himſelfe the vniuerſall Biſhop, the true Antichriſt himſelfe ſhall not make himſelfe that, but ſome other thing greater, <hi>viz.</hi> he ſhall extoll himſelfe aboue all that is called God: or if the true Antichriſt ſhall only make himſelfe the <hi>Vniuerſall Bishop,</hi> that <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who did this, was not the forerunner of Antichriſt, but the true An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt himſelfe, which notwithſtanding neither <hi>S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> nor our Aduerſaries ſay. Wherfore the ſenſe of <hi>S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi> words is, that becauſe Antichriſt ſhall be moſt proud, and the head of all the proud, ſo that he will not ſuffer any equalls, therfore whoſoeuer vſurpeth to himſelfe any thing otherwiſe then he ought, and will exceed and ſurpaſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is his forerunner: and ſuch were the Biſhops of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> who being in the beginning but Archbiſhops, firſt vſurped to themſelues to be Patriarches, and after the title of <hi>Vniuerſall.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In like manner when <hi>S. Gregory</hi> ſayth, <hi>an army of Prieſts</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXI"/> 
                     <hi>is prepared for him,</hi> he meaneth not, that Prieſts, as Prieſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the army of Antichriſt, for ſo he ſhould haue put himſelfe in that army, but that Prieſts as they are proude, prepare an army for Antichriſt: for he ſpeaketh of the ſame <hi>Iohn,</hi> and of Prieſts like him, who were extolled aboue the reſt vniuſtly. But hence it followeth not, that Antichriſt ſhall be the Prince of Prieſts, but that he ſhall be the Prince

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Out of this ſixt head we haue a notable argument, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXII"/> the Pope is not Antichriſt, ſince his Seate is not <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> nor in the Temple of <hi>Salomon;</hi> yea it is credible ſince the yeare 600. no Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was euer at <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>

But all this is but in his owne proud and fooliſh conceipt, for all but himſelfe will be eaſily perſwaded, that there was more wit and true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:15294:131"/> in the meaneſt of theſe ancient Fathers, then there is in this inſolent Miniſter, though he had many of his fellow Miniſters ioyned with him.

                  <p>Thirdly he addeth that <hi>it were not materiall, though this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition were more litterall, vnles the litterall were vſuall.</hi> And to ſhew that it is not vſuall, he obſerueth, that <hi>in all the Epiſtles, by the Temple of God is meant the Church,</hi> where firſt the Reader muſt marke that the word <hi>Temple</hi> is not vſed in any Epiſtle, but only in this place of the 2. <hi>to the Theſſalonians,</hi> and in the 2. <hi>to the Corinthians,</hi> and only in 3.

But how can this be applied to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſitting in the Temple of God, and ſhewing himſelfe as if he were God? Can Antichriſt dwell in the ſoules and bodies of men, as in his Temple? Or if he could, were this hidden and ſpirituall ſitting any oſtentation, or ſhewing of himſelfe as God? And yet in this place <hi>S. Paul</hi> affirmeth that Antichriſt ſhall do ſo, for which no doubt he muſt ſit viſibly in a viſible Temple, by which moſt properly is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified the <hi>Temple of Hieruſalem,</hi> yea when <hi>S. Paul</hi> wrote, and for many yeares after, only that was ſo called, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proueth, and is to be ſeene in all the foure Euangeliſts, and the Acts of the Apoſtles. Wherfore ſince this place may, yea indeed muſt litterally be vnderſtood of a materiall Temple, aſwell as many other places of the new Teſtament, it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous folly in <hi>M.

Downam</hi> hauing thus ſhufled vp the matter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> hitherto, at length commeth to explicate himſelfe more plainly, and agreeth with <hi>Caluin,</hi> that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vnder the Pope <hi>may be called the Church of God, in reſpect both of ſome notes and ſignes of a viſible Church, as the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Baptiſme, <hi>and the profeſſion of the Name of Chriſt,</hi> as alſo <hi>of ſome reliques and remainder, as it were the gleanings of the inuiſible Church,</hi> for he doubteth not, but that, <hi>in the corrupteſt times of Popery, the Lord hath reſerued ſome who haue not receaued the marke of the beaſt.</hi> And for explication he compareth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to the ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> vnder <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>Achab,</hi> becauſe they then <hi>retained the Sacrament of Circumciſion,</hi> and <hi>profeſſed Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houa to be their God, although they worshipped him Idolatrouſly. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnder Achab, the Lord had reſerued</hi> 7000. <hi>who neuer bowed their knee to Baal.</hi> In which compariſon <hi>M. Downam</hi> inſiſteth who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Downam his petitio principij.</note> vpon his wonted figure of <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all that he ſaith is but meere railing. If he would haue ſaid any thing to the purpoſe, he ſhould haue ſhewed two points in that example: the firſt that the viſible Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes was altogeather ceaſed, by that Idolatry of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The ſecond, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> departed not from the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which was generally houlden before, but that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Religion was by little and little changed to Idolatry, and that thoſe which came after, ſeparated themſelues from the former, and yet were the true Church. With theſe two
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:15294:133"/> points <hi>M. Downam</hi> might haue made ſome compariſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But ſince <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants like to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael &amp; the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes to Iuda.</note> neither of theſe are ſo, but the quite contrary, it will fall to <hi>M. Downam</hi> and his fellowes ſhare to be like the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſince they haue left the viſible Church, of which they once were, as the other did, and conſequently the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is like to the people of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and the reſt which ioyned with them, ſince it continueth in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent faith generally holden throughout Chriſtendome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were any Proteſtants in the World. Neither do we graunt, that the Proteſtants haue any part of Chriſts Church, no more then the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had, ſince they haue not any iote of true faith, howſoeuer they make profeſſion of ſome articles: for the reaſon why they hould them, is not the authority of God propoſed by the Scriptures, or the Church, but only their owne fancies, becauſe ſo it ſeemed neceſſary for their reputation and credit, or ſome other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and priuate reſpect, how much ſoeuer they pretend to be only moued by Scripture, for of this they admit no more <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants haue no probable rule of faith, nor any true faith at al.</note> then they pleaſe, and for the interpretation, they haue no other rule, then their owne pruate ſpirit, or fancy, which is far of from being any probable rule of truth, &amp; much leſſe ſo certaine as is neceſſary for the certainty of diuine and ſupernatural faith to be built vpon. And this is the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Church of God is but one, becauſe there is but one rule of fayth: from which whoſoeuer falleth, cannot haue any true faith at all, nor belong to the true Church of God. The other compariſon which <hi>M.

To all which <hi>M. Downam</hi> giueth him not a word, but is very well content to be thus beaten, ſo that it may not be ſpoken of: but to the other proofe, he thinketh himſelfe able to ſay ſomething, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore anſwereth two wayes, 1. that though <hi>Popish Rome</hi> had not dominion ouer the Kings of the earth, and were not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXV"/> drunke with the blould of the Saints and martyrs of <hi>Ieſus, yet we might vnderſtand the Apoſtle thus, that, that Citty, which then had dominion ouer the Kings of the earth, and then perſecuted the Saints, is called Babylon, becauſe it was to be the ſeate, or ſea of Antichriſt.</hi> So
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:15294:134"/> that as you ſee <hi>M. Downam</hi> will haue <hi>Rome</hi> to be called <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe it was to be the ſeate or ſea of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, which he ſuppoſeth as manifeſt, though <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> in this third ſolution, and before alſo in one of his arguments (both which <hi>M. Downam</hi> paſſeth ouer in ſilence) ſheweth manifeſtly, that Antichriſt ſhall hate this <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not make it the ſeat of his kingdome. So that this firſt ſolution is nothing but <hi>M. Downams</hi> wonted fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> not only without any proofe, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he vſeth it, but againſt euident proofe, which alſo he is forced to do now and then. His ſecond ſolution is, that <hi>theſe notes agree alſo to Popish Rome, both in reſpect of dominion, vſurped more inſolently ouer the Kings of the earth by the Pope, then by any Emperour, and in regard of moſt cruell perſecution of the Saintes of Chriſt.</hi> To which impudent aſſertion of his, I ſee not what <note place="margin">The Pope hath only a ſpiritual power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> other anſwere can be giuen, but to refer the matter to the Readers iudgment, who will eaſily perceaue, that the Pope hath now only a ſpirituall power ouer Kings, aſwell as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer other Chriſtians for the good of their ſoules, without exacting or vſurping any temporall dominion ouer their perſons or eſtates, as the old Roman Emperours did, to whome they were Tributary, if not altogeather ſubiect: and whatſoeuer the Pope doth in temporall affaires, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from his ſpirituall authority, to which no doubt temporall things do ſo farre belong, as they may hinder or help the good of ſoules, and no further, as is largely explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine,</hi> and other Catholike Deuines. And as for <hi>M. Downams</hi> Saints which the Pope doth perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, I am content to referre the deciſion of this queſtion, whether <hi>Chriſtian Rome</hi> may be called <hi>Babylon</hi> or no, till he hath ſhewed vs an authenticall canonization of theſe his Saints, and in the meane time it ſhall be alſo as certane, that <hi>Ethnick Rome</hi> is meant by <hi>Babylon,</hi> as that thoſe bleſſed Martyrs which died in thoſe daies, were truly the Martyrs of Chriſt and glorious Saints.</p>

Paul</hi> called the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> which as you ſee is no hard matter to do, ſince that he ſpeaketh of it, as it was in his time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was moſt truly the Temple of God, and beſides ſince Antichriſt ſhall build it againe for the Iewes, and pretend not to withdraw them from the true God, but to profeſſe himſelf to come from him, at leaſt before he diſcouereth himſelfe further, the temple erected by him may be called the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> though when he ſhall ſit in it, and ſhew himſelfe as God, he will profeſſe himſelfe to be the true God, and ſo either auouch that he is the God of the Iewes, in whoſe Temple he ſhall ſit, or els extoll himſelfe aboue him, for ſo much the words of <hi>S.

                     <hi>niſi in fine mundi.</hi> To that of <hi>Daniel</hi> I anſwere, that either <hi>Daniel</hi> would ſay, that the Temple is not to built againe but in the end of the world: and is not this a great ſhame for a Doctour of Diuinity, to be taken in ſo groſſe an abſurdity, that either he muſt confeſſe that he cannot conſter two words of latin, or els that he is a wilfull falſifier? Well now that we haue <hi>Bellarmines</hi> true words, let <hi>M. Downam</hi> vrge our text, and <hi>S.

But againſt this <hi>M.

                  <q>That all theſe things are in ſome ſort true, and belong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> to Antichriſt, our Aduerſaries agree with vs: But the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is of the ſenſe of theſe foure heads, for the Catholikes vnderſtand them plainely, and as the words of Scripture ſound, that Antichriſt will deny the true Chriſt, make himſelfe Chriſt, proclaime himſefe God, &amp; deteſt all other Gods and Idols. Out of which are taken foure arguments that the Pope is not Antichriſt: for it is manifeſt that the Pope denieth not Ieſus to be Chriſt, nor bringeth in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, or the Sabaoth, inſteed of Baptiſme, and our Lords day. And likewiſe it is manifeſt that the Pope doth not make himſelfe Chriſt nor God; and chiefly it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that he maketh not himſelfe the only God, ſince that he openly worſhippeth Chriſt, and the Trinity, and in our aduerſaries conceipt he worſhippeth all Idolls, that is, Images and Saints departed.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>But our Aduerſaries interprete all theſe things farre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> otherwiſe, for firſt they ſay, that Antichriſt will not deny in word and openly, that Ieſus is Chriſt, nor Baptiſme and other Sacraments, but that he will deny him in worke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vnder the colour of chriſtianiſme and the Church, he will corrupt the doctrine of Sacraments, of Iuſtification &amp;c. <hi>Caluinus lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. §. 25. <hi>VVe gather</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Tyranny of Antichriſt is ſuch, that it abolisheth not the name of Chriſt, or of the Church, but rather abuſeth it vnder the colour &amp; pretext of Chriſt, and lieth lurking vnder the title of the Church, as vnder a vizard.

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:15294:139"/> and God in the Church, making himſelfe the head of all the faithfull, which belongeth only to Chriſt. So the <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes loc. cit.

                  <q>Finally, they ſay that Antichriſt ſhall not reiect Idols, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> yea that he ſhall adore them openly, which they proue out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who <hi>cap.</hi> 11. after that he had ſaid, that Antichriſt ſhould riſe againſt all the Gods, addeth: <hi>But he shall reuerence the God</hi> Maozim <hi>in his place, and he shall worship the God whome their Fathers knew not, with gold and ſiluer, and precious ſtones &amp;c.</hi> And by <hi>Maozim</hi> the heretikes vnderſtand the ornaments of the Churches, the Maſſes, Images, Reliques, and other like.

Likewiſe Chriſt ſubiected himſelfe to the Scripture ſaying, that he did and ſuffered thoſe things, which he did and ſuffered, that the Scripture might be fullfilled: but the Pope ſayth, that he can diſpence againſt an Apoſtle or Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, and make thoſe things which ſeeme right to be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp;c.

                  <q>Now the two arguments of <hi>Illyricus</hi> are of no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for in the firſt, he committeth three faults.

Paul</hi> ought to explicate the words of Chriſt. Secondly, in that he ſaith, that <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. <hi>To come in the name of Chriſt,</hi> doth ſignify the ſame, as to be the Vicar of Chriſt: For the explication of Chriſt himſelfe, is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to this explication of <hi>Illyricus,</hi> for when our Lord had ſayd: <hi>Many will come in my name,</hi> forth with he addeth explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſaying: <hi>I am Chriſt.</hi> Wherfore to come in the name of Chriſt in that place, is to vſurp to themſelues the name of Chriſt, which in old time <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did, as witneſſeth <hi>S. Iren. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. and in our time <hi>Dauid Georgius:</hi> and at length Antichriſt himſelfe ſhall do. But the Pope euen in that he nameth himſelfe the Vicar of Chriſt, doth make himſelfe not to be Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Illyricus</hi> his third fault is, that he maketh Chriſt an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/> vnfit interpreter of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> for he doth not rightly expound that place of <hi>S. Paul (He extolleth himſelfe aboue all Gods)</hi> by this <hi>(many will come in my name, that is, will make themſelues my Vicars)</hi> for the Vicar of God is not aboue all Gods, but vnder all Gods, as the Vicar of a King, is vnder all Kings, for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined or deuiſed how he, that profeſſeth himſelfe to be the Vicegerent of any King, ſhould boaſt, that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all Kings, by which the blindneſſe and impudency of our Aduerſaries is apparent, who ſomtime vtter ſuch things as are againſt common ſenſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And to that argument of <hi>Illyricus,</hi> by which he proued, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/> that the Pope did vſurpe greater authority then Chriſt hath; I anſwere, that the propoſition and aſſumption of that argument, are two lyes, and beſides, that the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is nothing worth. For firſt it is falſe, that Chriſt ſubiected himſelfe to the Scriptures, ſince that it is manifeſt, that he is the Author of the Scriptures, and therfore aboue the Scriptures: and when we read that Chriſt did thoſe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:15294:143"/> things which he did, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>vt,</hi> or <hi>this,</hi> ſignifyeth not the cauſe, but the euent, as <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> teach in <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Ioan.</hi> for Chriſt did not dye becauſe <hi>Iſay</hi> wrote ſo, but <hi>Iſay</hi> wrote it, becauſe it was to be.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is alſo falſe, that the Pope euer ſayd in word or in dead, that he can diſpenſe againſt an Euangeliſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/> or Apoſtle, for though he can diſpenſe in the poſitiue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Apoſtles, yet this is not againſt an Apoſtle, but according to an Apoſtle, who doubtles knew, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike power, by which he ordained ſomething in the Church for a time, was to be in his ſucceſſors, by which they might moderate or change the ſame thinges, as ſhould be expedient for the Church. But in the <hi>Euangelicall,</hi> that is the diuine percepts, no Catholike euer ſaid, that the Pope could any way diſpenſe.</p>
               <p>Finally the conſequence is naught, for in the <hi>Maior,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIV"/> or Propoſition, <hi>Illyricus</hi> ſpeaketh of the ſubiection of Chriſt vnder the Scriptures, not concerning the precepts, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Propheſies, for <hi>Illyricus</hi> was not ignorant that Chriſt had taken away the Sabboath, and abrogated the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Law: &amp; in the <hi>Minor</hi> or Aſſumption, he ſpeaketh of precepts; and ſo his argument hath foure termes, and can conclude nothing. This ſhall ſuffice for the doctrine of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt in this place.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. For anſwere to the ſecond argument, <hi>M. Downam</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> denieth, that <hi>S. Iohn in that place ſpeaketh either of the body of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi>

                     <hi>in generall, or of the head of that body in particuler, but of Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus and others, which denied the Diuinity of Chriſt, as appeareth plainly by that which followeth in the text: This is that Antichriſt that denieth the Father &amp; the Sonne.</hi> But <hi>M. Downam</hi> might haue reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred how <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his ſecond argument obſerued, that in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the article was put in, and in ſome left out, to ſignifie when Antichriſt himſelf was ſpoken of, and when his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners or members. Wherfore ſince the article is put heere, it is euident, that the chiefe Antichriſt himſelf is ſpoken of. Neither is it to the purpoſe, that <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and other deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Diuinity of Chriſt, for <hi>S. Iohn</hi> denieth not, but that others may deny it aſwell as Antichriſt, but only affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that he ſhall deny <hi>Ieſus</hi> to be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and likewiſe the Diuinity both of Chriſt and his Father, which others did indirectly and by conſequence, as <hi>M.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:15294:144"/> for he ſpeaketh abſolutly, and affirmeth, that Antichriſt ſhall deny aſwell the Diuinity of the Father, as of Chriſt. And by this <hi>M.

But this is a great miſtaking, ſince in this place Antichriſt is with an article: by which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> gathereth, that Antichriſt himſelfe is ſpoken of, as before, where the Apoſtle ſaith, that many were become Antichriſts, there is no article, and therfore the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of heretikes.

And though thoſe other compariſons which <hi>M.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:15294:144"/> confirmeth it, becauſe the Diuell is ſaid to worke the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of iniquity by heretikes, but the comming of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is called a reuelation. To which <hi>M. Downam</hi> replieth, that <hi>the myſtery of iniquity</hi> 2. Theſſ. 2. 7. <hi>is Antichriſtianiſme, or that Antichriſtian Apoſtaſie from Chriſt, mentioned verſ.</hi> 3.

                     <hi>Downam</hi> might remember, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his anſwere to his third obiection againſt his ſecond principall argument, ſheweth, that the departure or Apoſtaſy mentioned <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, hath diuers interpretations, and therfore he ſhould not haue taken this as the only. Well we will not ſtand with him in this, ſince the expoſition is probable, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> declareth in that place: but we can by no meanes grant, that the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of iniquity, and this Apoſtaſy is all one, ſince that (as we haue ſhewed before) <hi>S.

                        <hi>See cap.</hi> 2. §. 6.

And in like manner alſo he diſtinguiſheth the reuelation of Antichriſt, for of that he likewiſe ſayth, that it was to be afterward, wherfore I cannot ſee how <hi>M. Downam</hi> can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the myſtery of iniquity doth moſt truely belong to Antichriſt himſelfe, vnleſſe he would alſo graunt, that Antichriſt himſelfe was come in <hi>S. Pauls</hi> time, which I think he will be loth to do, becauſe if will euidently follow, that either the Pope is not Antichriſt himſelfe, or els that <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> or whoſoeuer els he will make Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>S. Pauls</hi> time, was Antichriſt. Wherfore ſince Antichriſt himſelfe was not come at that time, it is alſo euident, that <hi>S.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, ſhall be plainely reuealed and auouched by him, which is all that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> needeth for the force of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for now we talke not of the time, or manner of this reuelation, hauing done that ſufficiently in other places. But <hi>M. Downam</hi> muſt needs ſay ſomething, though it be nothing at all to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>M. Downam</hi> will needs deuide <hi>Bellarmines</hi> poſition into two parts, of the former of which we haue treated hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto: the latter is, that Antichriſt ſhall impugne all the ordinances of Chriſt, &amp; teach that Circumciſion, the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:15294:145"/> and the other cerimonies of the law are not ceaſed. This is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> aſſertion, and not as <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſetteth it downe, changing a word or two which may ſeeme to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port nothing: but yet <hi>M. Downam</hi> had a meaning in it, as we ſhall ſee afterward. Now the latter dependeth ſo vpon the former part, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth no particuler proofes for it, as indeed he need not, ſince it was but an explication of the former; &amp; yet <hi>M. Downam</hi> will needs haue him proue <note place="margin">Downam his trifling</note> the latter by the former, and by the firſt argument with which he proued the former, which is nothing but meere trifeling, and to giue himſelfe an occaſion to make an idle repetition of part of that, which he had ſaid before. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore omitting this, let vs ſee, how he anſwereth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>To which firſt in generall he giueth this cenſure, that <hi>in this queſtion they deſcrue no further credit, then they conſpire with the</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> 
                     <hi>Propheſies of Scripture, and agree with the euent.</hi> Both which latter you muſt giue <hi>M. Downam</hi> liberty to interpret and declare as he thinketh good. And beſides I would faine know, what queſtions thoſe be, in which <hi>M. Downam</hi> will giue the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers credit, without this, or the like limitations? Well the cenſure preſuppoſed, <hi>M. Downam</hi> is content for this time to vouchſafe euery Father his particuler anſwere, and firſt to <hi>S. Hilary</hi> he ſaith, that he calleth thoſe heretikes, <hi>who deny Chriſt to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Antichriſt ſhall deny Chriſt to be ſo much as the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sonne of God.</note> 
                     <hi>be the naturall Sonne of God,</hi> Antichriſt. And is not this a trim anſwere trow you?

For thoſe who thinke Chriſt to be a creature, muſt needes alſo take Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt to be Chriſt, becauſe a creature hath not the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of a ſonne, and he doth falſly affirme himſelfe to be the Sonne of God: and therfore they who deny this Sonne of God now, wil belieue him to be Chriſt then. Where we ſee, that <hi>S.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:15294:148"/> do. Neither can he help himſelfe by flying to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for aide, for no man reuerenceth the Fathers more then he, and it is falſe that he euer gaue any ſuch rule, that <hi>we are not to</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>M. Downam</hi> is much miſtaken in the matter: for Antichriſt ſhall not only extoll himſelfe aboue all other Gods; but oppoſe himſelfe againſt them all, for ſo <hi>S. Paul</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Antichriſt ſhall not extoll him ſelf aboue all other Gods, but alſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt them all.</note> ſayth: <hi>Qui aduerſatur &amp; extollitur, who is oppoſed and extolled.</hi> Now how this aduancing and oppoſing himſelfe can ſtand with ſuffering, yea requiring them to be worſhipped as God, wil be very hard for <hi>M. Downam,</hi> or any other to explicate. Iupiter was ſuppoſed by the Gentiles to be the Father and King of the other Gods, but likewiſe he was ſuppoſed to loue them, as his children and ſeruants, and not to oppoſe himſelfe vnto them. The other two inſtances are both falſe and fooliſh, for that ſecond beaſt is not Antichriſt, as <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſuppoſeth, nor yet aduanceth himſelf aboue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <note place="margin">Iupiter.</note> by which indeed Antichriſt is ſignified, and not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Empire. The Pope aduanceth not himſelfe aboue the Angels, Saints, the Hoſt, the Croſſe &amp;c. as <hi>M. Downam</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Downam belyeth the Pope.</note> belieth him: He is indeed the Paſtour and the Biſhop of KIngs aſwell as of others, and in that reſpect preferred before them by Chriſt himſelfe. But what hindrance is this that he may not command Princes to be honored and obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their ſubiects, as he doth? Or what haue any of theſe compariſons to do with the odoration of God, as God, which he that is oppoſite and extolled aboue all them, that take that name vpon them, ſhould ſuffer or require it to be giuen to others? And beſides it is plaine, that this oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and aduancement of Antichriſt aboue all other Gods, ſhallbe for no other cauſe, but becauſe they are called Gods, for if the cauſe were particuler, the quarrell would not be ſo general. As if it ſhould be true of any King, that he oppoſeth and adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth himſelf aboue al that are called Kings, it were euident, that his quarrel againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were no other, then for that they were Kings, and were to called, and it were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly <note place="margin">Why An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uanceth and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him ſelf aboue all other Gods.</note> againſt his will, that any other King ſhould raigne, or be acknowledged for a King but himſelfe, and he would be far inough from ſuffering, yea requiring, that any of them ſhould be worſhipped, and further alſo from acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, or worſhipping any of them himſelfe for King. Secondly <hi>M. Downam</hi> confirmeth this his anſwere by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:15294:151"/> of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes, who aduanceth himſelfe againſt euery God, yea againſt the God of Gods, Dan.</hi> 11. 56. <hi>and yet he was neuer</hi>

                     <hi>ſo mad, as to profeſſe himſelfe the only God.</hi> But to this the anſwere is eaſy, that this place cannot be vnderſtood of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> but only of Antichriſt, as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> ſheweth for this very reaſon, that <hi>Antiochus</hi> did not aduance himſelfe againſt euery God, for he was a great Idolater himſelfe. Thirdly <hi>M. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> ſuppoſeth, that he hath proued <hi>Antichriſtianiſme</hi> not to be <hi>open Atheiſme, but a myſtery of iniquity</hi> &amp;c. But we proued before, that it cannot be the myſtery of iniquity, &amp; yet it ſhall not <note place="margin">Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſme is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme.</note> properly be Atheiſme, ſince thoſe which follow Antichriſt ſhall take him for their God, and he himſelfe, though open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he will worſhip no God, becauſe he will profeſſe himſelfe to be God himſefe, yet ſecretly it is not vnprobable, that he will adore the Diuell as his God. Fourthly <hi>M. Downam</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth out of the text it ſelfe, which he ſayth, <hi>doth not aſcribe to Antichriſt ſo great an extolling of himſelfe, as the Ieſuite imagineth:</hi> firſt, becauſe, <hi>he is called a man of ſinne, and Sonne of perdition, and therefore we are to conceaue of ſuch an aduancement of himſelfe, as is incident to a mortall and wretched man.</hi> But to this of the morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, I haue anſwered ſufficiently before, and the words of the text rather giue vs occaſion to increaſe, then any way to diminiſh Antichriſts ſinne, ſince that he is called <hi>Antonoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticè</hi>

Secondly, by al that is called God in this place, <hi>M.

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:15294:152"/> which (he thinketh) that <hi>a man may aduance himſelfe (as the Pope doth) and yet may acknowledg ſome other God beſides himſelfe</hi> But to <note place="margin">How the Pope may be called God.</note> anſwere briefly, though it be true, that Kings &amp;c. and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:15294:156"/> without giuing him any anſwere at all, or taking any notice of any ſuch proofe. And the ſecond point, ſo far as it is different from the former, is affirmed alſo by vs, for we only differ from the Proteſtants, in that they affirme, that Antichriſt is to be reuealed in the Church of God. And we alſo affirme, that he is not to be reuealed till after the Roman Empire be taken out of the way by the 10. Kings, which ſhall rule togeather at Antichriſts comming.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore, ſecondly <hi>M.

And is <note place="margin">Downam acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be againſt him.</note> not this all one in effect with that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth?

Downam</hi> to make his expoſition good by the euent, is no more in effect but to ſay, that he will firſt ſuppoſe as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine out of his owne head, and without all Scripture, that the Pope is Antichriſt, and then afterward he will make the Scripture ſay ſo by one deuice or other, and to all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt this interpretation he will anſwere, that the euent is cleare, and conſequently the obiection nothing worth. And this indeed is the Proteſtants proceeding in all controuerſies, by which they make their owne idle &amp; foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh fancy the rule of Faith, and of Scripture, and Fathers, <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceeding in all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies.</note> and all other proofes.

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:15294:157"/> which might perhaps haue had ſome ſway, if he had anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Bellarmines</hi> euident proofe to the contrary, or impugned his ſolution taken out of <hi>S. Chryſoſtome,</hi> and <hi>S. Auguſtine.</hi> But <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See part.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5. §. 10. 11. 12.</note> ſince he is altogeather ſilent in both, the Reader hath good cauſe to ſuſpect, that he is ſo impudent and ſhameleſſe, that he will affirme that, which he can neither proue nor defend. And conſequently at leaſt ſuſpend his iudgement of thoſe many inſtances and moſt euident allegations, for the other two points, which he boaſteth of till we come to that place, where they are to be examined. And now for concluſion of this whole argument and diſcourſe I will intreate the Reader to conſider his ſubſtantiall reply againſt <hi>Bellarmines</hi> anſwere concerning <hi>Illyricus</hi> his conſequence; for thus <hi>M. Downam</hi> writeth: <hi>for that which he (Bellarmine) addeth of Chriſt his ſubiecting himſelfe to the Propheſyes, and not to the preceptes, as though Illyricus had ſpoken of the one in his propoſition, and of the other in the aſſumption, it is partely falſe, and partely ridiculous, and indeed not worth the anſwering.</hi> Thus <hi>M. Downam,</hi> as it ſeemeth, in a great chafe at <hi>Bellarmines</hi> vnlearned anſwer. But good <hi>Syr,</hi> vouchſafe out of your high wiſdome to ſhew vs in what this anſwere is either falſe or ridiculous; for is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that <hi>Illyricus</hi> would be ſo mad, as to affirme, that Chriſt was ſubiect to the preceptes of the law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in the Scripture, and abrogated by Chriſt as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> ſheweth? and conſequently when <hi>Illyricus</hi> in his <hi>Maior,</hi> or propoſition affirmeth, that Chriſt ſubiected himſelfe to the Scriptures, muſt it not needes be vnderſtood only of the Propheſies? of which notwithſtanding it is alſo falſe, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proueth, &amp; when in his minor, or aſſumption he ſaith, that the Pope affirmeth, that he can diſpenſe againſt an Apoſtle or Euangeliſt, &amp; make thoſe things, which are right to be wicked, is it not alſo euident, that he ſpeaketh only of precepts? Wherefore to me it ſeemeth alſo euident that <hi>M. Downam</hi> is ridiculous at leaſt, if not a falſe fellow to anſwere in this ſort, and that he moſt impudently called that not worth the anſwerering, which in his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">M Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency.</note> he knew to be vnanſwerable.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:15294:167"/> applied to him, but all cannot, and therefore part muſt of force be referred to Antichriſt euen litterally; and that which may be verified of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> muſt likewiſe be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Antichriſt, in whom it is more perfectly to be fulfilled.

                     <hi>Antiochus,</hi> but only of Antichriſt, neither is it the ſame little horne, which is ſpoken of in that Chapter, and in the 8. as is moſt manifeſt: for the little horne in the 7.

                  <p>2. But <hi>M. Downam</hi> telleth vs, that <hi>the learned of our tymes, haue made the contrary cleere:</hi> but he omitteth their proofes, and only alleadgeth out of <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> that <hi>Porphyry that learned,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Praefat. in Dan.</note> 
                     <hi>though malicius enemy of Chriſtianity, perceaued Daniels Propheſies in the</hi> 7. 8. 11. <hi>and</hi> 12. <hi>Chapters, ſo fully and perfectly to agree to Antiochus Epiphanes, that he affirmed that they were written not before hand by Daniel, but after the fulfilling of them by ſome one that liued in the tymes of Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> But <hi>M. Downam</hi> findeth not in <hi>S. Hierome</hi> thoſe 4. Chapters ſpecified, which he ſetteth down, but only a generall aſſertion, that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſeemed rather to <note place="margin">Hierome and three other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wrote expreſly againſt Downams expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> haue written a ſtory then a propheſy: yea <hi>S.

Chapters can be wholy vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and in this agreed with him all writers, aſwell Chriſtians as Iewes, and in particuler <hi>Methodius, Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> and <hi>Apollinaris</hi> wrote largely againſt <hi>Porphyry</hi> anſwering his mad obiections, among which no doubt this was one
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:15294:167"/> which <hi>M. Downam</hi> and his learned men take vpon them ſo ſtiffely to defend, and for that cauſe will ſeeme to ſome to pertake with <hi>Porphyry</hi> in his malicious cauills.</p>
                  <p>3. Thus far <hi>M. Downam</hi> hath byn conſtrained to fly to <hi>Porphyry,</hi> that wicked Gentile, againſt both Iewes and Chriſtians. Now he hath gotten himſelfe a Iew to ioyne <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 11.</note> with him againſt the Pope, for ſo he ſaith, that <hi>not only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, but alſo the Iewes, and namely R. Leui Gerſon expoundeth the</hi> 7. <hi>and</hi> 11. <hi>chap. of Dan. as ſpoken of the Pope of Rome, whom he calleth another Pharao:</hi> which pleaſeth this man very well, who thinketh that he hath gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a great aduantage againſt the Pope, becauſe not only Heretiks, but alſo Iewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues impugne him. And yet fearing leaſt this <hi>Rabbin</hi> be not able to make his party good, he ſtill ſticketh rather to <hi>Porphyry,</hi> affirming, that only <hi>Antiochus</hi> is litterally ſpoken of <note place="margin">Antiochus a type of Antichriſt only in ſome principall pointes.</note> in thoſe places, and that conſequently, there can no ſound argument concerning Antichriſt be taken from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Antiochus</hi> was a tipe of Antichriſt, not in all and euery particuler, but in ſome principall matters. In which <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſayth true, and I thinke there was neuer yet any ſo mad, as to auouch the contrary, and the like no doubt is to be ſaid of the Types of Chriſt, which <hi>M. Downam</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth, only the controuerſy may be, what thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal matters are, in which <hi>Antiochus</hi> was the Type of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. But euen in theſe alſo he ſeemeth to affirme, that there can be no ſound argument taken from the Tipe, for he vniuerſally alloweth of <hi>that rule of Diuinity, ſet downe by the Schoolemen, that, Theologia Symbolica non eſt argumentatiua,</hi> which notwithſtanding, he muſt vnderſtand <hi>praeciſè, &amp; per ſe,</hi> as the Schoolmen do, in which ſenſe it only ſignifieth, that it is no good argument in all poynts to argue from the Type, to that which it ſignifieth; which is all, that his other argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Allegories proueth alſo. And conſequently it wil ſtil be a good argument from the allegorical, myſtical, or ſpirituall <note place="margin">How we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſenſe.</note> ſenſe to infer ſuch things as the type is a figure of. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, now that we know by the Scripture, that the Paſchall Lambe was a figure of Chriſt, not only in other reſpects, but alſo in that the bones of it were not to be broken, we may very wel bring that place of <hi>Exodus</hi> 12. <hi>necos illius confrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getis,</hi>
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:15294:168"/> to proue, that Chriſt had not his thighes broken, as the two theeues had. And the reaſon of this is, for that the myſtical and ſpiritual ſenſe, is aſwel intended by the holy Ghoſt, as the Litteral or Hyſtorical, yea for the moſt part in the old Teſtament much more, as is euident by the place alleadged; wherfore the only cauſe, why we cannot vſe it in our proofes, is, becauſe it is hidden and vncertaine, ſo that when it is knowne certainly, it conuinceth as much as the litteral doth: for which cauſe the Apoſtles, to whom <note place="margin">Except the litteral ſenſe be certain we cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from it.</note> it was reuealed, vſed it ſo often. But we can proue nothing firmly eyther by the myſtical, or litterall ſenſe, except we be ſure, that we haue the right of each, which we can neuer ſe by our owne wits and induſtry without the aſſiſtance of that ſpirit, with which al Scriptures were written. Neyther can any man in particuler without great preſumption, &amp; euident danger of errour, promiſe this aſſiſtance to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but no doubt the Church of Chriſt is neuer without it, &amp; therfore we may boldly build vpon any expoſition, which ſhe houldeth for certayne, as ſhe doth all thoſe, in which all the Fathers, Doctors, and Paſtors giuen vnto her, by her ſpouſe, do fully agree, as we ſee they do in expounding this place of Antichriſt: and therfore we are to be out of doubt, that it is a true expoſition, whether it be litteral or ſpirituall, of which there may be ſome queſtion; Neither doth <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſeeme much to ſtriue, but that in ſome thinges concerning Antichriſt, the proofe out of this place is good inough. But he would haue vs giue him leaue to chooſe them out, which we can do with no ſecurity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he firſt ſhew vs an authenticall warrant, for ſo high &amp; ſpeciall a priuiledge: which becauſe he can neuer be able to do, we muſt of force neglect his babling, and liſten to the conſent of the Fathers, to whom it doth belong to ſhew <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Fathers maketh eyther lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall or myſticall ſenſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> vs, in what points <hi>Antiochus,</hi> &amp; Antichriſt are to agree, and in what to differ, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth in this place; though (as I noted before) there be many things in the 11. chapter. which cannot be vnderſtood of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and therfore are litterally to be referred to Antichriſt, and much more all that, which is ſpoken of the little horne in the ſeauenth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, in which there is no mention of <hi>Antiochus</hi> at all.</p>

                  <p> 4. After this generall anſwer, <hi>M.

                     <hi>ſtand vp a vyle perſon, meaning therby Antiochus &amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>M. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> prouing very well that <hi>Antiochus</hi> is ſpoken of, which no man denyed, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> expreſly alleageth <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> expoſition in that ſenſe; but withall addeth, that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians vnderſtood it alſo of Antichriſt, and that more right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> iudgment. This <hi>M. Downam</hi> ſhould haue impugned: which he in no ſort doth, by telling vs, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> is ſpoken of, becauſe both <hi>Antiochus</hi> and Antichriſt may be ſpoken of, if not litterally, at leaſt ſpiritually, which is ſufficient, ſo that it be certaine, that thoſe words are to be applyed to him, as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> &amp; the other Chriſtians thought that they were.</p>
                  <p>5. After this, <hi>M. Downam</hi> entreth into a large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, telling vs firſt, <hi>that excepting one propheticall comfort of the Reſurrection,</hi> cap. 12. Daniels <hi>whole Propheſie is of thoſe things which happened within leſſe then</hi> 700. <hi>yeares, that is to ſay, from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Daniels propheſie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth many things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <hi>of Hieruſalem by the Chaldaeans, vnto the finall deſtruction therof by the Romans.</hi> Where firſt we are glad, that we haue gotten <hi>M. Downams</hi> conſent of that Propheſie of the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> for ſurely it is very probable, that it is not alone, but ioyned with many other concerning the conſummation of the world, to which the comming of Antichriſt doth belong. And this both the text it ſelfe, and <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> and all other Eccleſiaſticall Wryters perſwade vs, and therfore we muſt needs thinke ſo, vntill <hi>M. Downam</hi> conuinceth euidently the contrary, which I am affraid, he will very hardly doe. But let vs ſee, what he can ſay for himſelfe. Secondly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he faith, that <hi>Daniels Propheſies concerne, either ſuch terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall Kingdomes, vnto whoſe Tyranny the Iewes were ſubiect before the comming of the Meſſias, or elſe the ſpirituall Kingdome of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>

                     <hi>which, all the former Kingdomes were to haue an end.</hi> But this ſeemeth ſomwhat contrary to that he ſaid before, when he confeſſed that <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſie reacheth to the finall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:15294:169"/> of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and conſequently there muſt needes in his opinion, be mention in <hi>Dan.</hi> of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall Kingdome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which without doubt, was not ended, before the comming of Chriſt; well, we will not vrge him too far with this, but rather conſider <note place="margin">The King domes where of Daniel ſpeaketh were not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before Chriſt.</note> how he proueth, that all the terreſtriall Kingdomes of which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaketh were to haue an end before the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Kingdome of Chriſt, for it ſeemeth ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelfe, who affirmeth, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt ſhould be raiſed by God in the daies of thoſe Kingdomes, wherof he ſpake. <hi>In diebus autem Regnorum illorum ſuſcitabit Deus Cali Regnum, quod in aeternum &amp;c.</hi> But yet <hi>M.

But I cannot ſee how this proueth <hi>M.

                  <p>6. Well <hi>M. Downam</hi> goeth forward with his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition (ſuch as it is) eſpecially of the 11. Chapter of <hi>Dan.</hi> in which he ſaith many thinges called in queſtion by none, <note place="margin">

Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> diſſembleth, and therefore interpreted <hi>Iudas Machabaeus</hi> to be that ſtone which <hi>Dan.</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>cap.</hi> 2. but moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſly, as is manifeſt out of the text; and therefore <hi>M. Downam</hi> durſt not go ſo far with him, though in this plate he affirmeth, that in <hi>Antiochus</hi> his tyme the people of God were freed from the tyranny of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> by <hi>Indas Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeus;</hi> which is all the ouerthrow he can ſhew vs, that the <note place="margin">The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the Lagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae and Seleucidae cannot be ſignified by the 4. beaſt Dan. 7.</note> ſtone gaue to the Statua, or 4. beaſt. Finally how can two of theſe Kingdomes, into which <hi>Alexanders</hi> Kingdome was deuided, be taken for the Kingdome ſignified by the 4. beaſt, which <hi>cap.</hi> 7. is affirmed to be greater then all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and to deuour the whole earth? whereas all thoſe 4.

Neither is it true, that theſe 4. Kingdomes were by mutuall conflictes reduced to two, vnder <hi>Seleucus Nicanor,</hi> and <hi>Prolomy Laegides;</hi> for (to omit the controuerſy about the 4. Kingdome, whether it were of <hi>Asia minor,</hi> or of <hi>Thracia,</hi> and <hi>Pontus)</hi> it is certaine that there
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:15294:170"/> were 14. Kinges of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which held that Kingdome about an hundred yeares, and 1. <hi>Machab.</hi> 1. they are all foure ſaid to haue reigned after <hi>Alexander,</hi> and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after them many years.</p>
                  <p>But no part of <hi>M. Downams</hi> expoſition is more abſurd, then his applications of the 10. Kinges of the <hi>Seloucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae</hi> to the 10. hornes of the beaſt mentioned <hi>cap.</hi> 7. for (to omit that this was <hi>Porphyries</hi> deuiſe, by which he made himſelfe ridiculous to all other expoſitours) <hi>M. Downams</hi> particuler application canteyneth ſo many abſurdityes, as I am perſuaded his freindes will bluſh, and all others will pitty the poore man; for firſt, whereas he putteth <hi>Seleucus Nicanor</hi> to be the 2. horne, taking one King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the next of <hi>Syria,</hi> becauſe <hi>Ptolomy Philadelphus</hi> who was the <note place="margin">Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nams ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition contrary to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, euen his owne fellowes.</note> ſecond King of <hi>Egypt</hi> was a great fauourer of the Iewes, he is conſtrayned to interprete the 5. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 11.

Chapter, as neither the 2. and another King, which is none of theſe hornes, is mentioned in their place, by which <hi>M. Downams</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Downam contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> aſſertion, <hi>that the</hi> 10. <hi>hornes which ſucceſſiuely tyrannized ouer lury are mentioned in order in this</hi> 11. <hi>Chapter, is</hi> wholy ouerthrown. Likewiſe he omitteth <hi>Seleucus Ceraunus</hi> elder brother to <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Maguus,</hi> though he alſo be mentioned in this Chapter. Fynally of all theſe 10. which he nameth hornes, becauſe they tyrannized ouer the people of the Iewes, he cannot proue, that aboue two of them perſecured, or in a manner moleſted the Iewes: indeed they were ſo buſied with their owne affayres, that they were rather glad to procure the Iewes to be their friends, then to exaſperate them. <hi>Ptolomy Lagides</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Egypt</hi> did inuade <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as other hiſtories report, but <hi>Daniel</hi> omitted it, which is a ſigne, that his intent in numbring theſe Kinges, was not to declare the perſecution, with which they were to afflict the Iewes, as <hi>M. Downam</hi> imagineth. Beſides him, it is only certaine,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:15294:171"/> that <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> the laſt horne in <hi>M. Downams</hi> accompt did the like, for that which he affirmeth of <hi>Ptolomy Philopater</hi> out of the 12. verſe, is a meere fable, ſince it is manifeſt out of <hi>Polybius lib.</hi> 5. and other hiſtories, that the thouſands, which there he is foretould to ouerthrow, were of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Antiochus Magnus,</hi> for he ſlew and tooke priſoners aboue 10. thouſand. And as for <hi>Antiochus Magnus</hi> himſelfe, true it is, that he came to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> not againſt the Iewes, but againſt <note place="margin">Antiochus magnus &amp; Seleucus Philopater his elder ſonne, were the Iewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors.</note> 
                     <hi>Scopas</hi> one of <hi>Ptolomyes</hi> Captaines, againſt whom the Iewes themſelues aſſiſted <hi>Antiochus,</hi> with which he was ſo well pleaſed, that he certified his Captaynes of the Iewes good vſage towards him, &amp; how he had decreed to reward them; for which cauſe he is by <hi>Ioſephus</hi> accompted one of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors. And the like we may ſay of <hi>Seleucus Philopater</hi> his elder ſonne in whoſe commendation the Scripture it ſelfe ſpeaketh 2. <hi>Mach.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4 teſtifying, that in his tyme the Citty of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was in all peace, and the Temple honoured with many guifts, aſwell by him, as it had byn before by his predeceſſors, and that he in particuler allowed all things neceſſary to the Sacrifices; and that which <hi>M.

                  <p>10. But firſt, he will haue a ſaying to the Pope, &amp; infer that according to their expoſition who think that the 4. beaſt, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. ſignifieth the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, it is <hi>very likely, that the Pope is</hi> Antichriſt, <hi>ſeing hitherto he is the laſt that hath ruled in Rome, and shall according to the Papiſts owne conceipt continue to the end,</hi>

Downam</hi> inſiſteth not much vpon this proofe, for firſt it is manifeſt, that not the Pope, but the Emperour is he that ſuceedeth in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and it is likewiſe falſe, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hould, that either the Pope, or the Emperour ſhall <hi>continue to the end</hi> in <hi>Rome:</hi> ſince they plainly affirme, that the Empire ſhalbe firſt deuided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong 10. Kings, wherof none of them ſhalbe Emperour, and after ſurpriſed by Antichriſt himſelf, who ſhall ſubdue <note place="margin">The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucidae are not ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified by the fourth beaſt.

Kings and Antichriſt, as we haue ſeene before, and yet beſides theſe two falſe aſſertions, <hi>M. Downam</hi> to make his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good, ſuppoſeth two other <hi>(ifs)</hi> as falſe as theſe. Firſt, that the ten hornes ſhould be the ſucceſſiue <hi>rulers of the Roman ſtate:</hi> and 2. that the 10. <hi>or laſt horne should be Antichriſt;</hi> which are not only falſe, but alſo fooliſh ſuppoſitions, and the latter expreſly againſt the Scripture which maketh Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt not the 10. but the 11. horne, as hath byn proued. Now let vs ſee how he can proue, that by the 4. beaſt is ſignified, not the Roman, but the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> and firſt he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:15294:173"/> it, out of that falſe ground, which we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ouerthrowne, that the kingdome ſignified by the fourth beaſt, was <hi>to haue an end before the comming of the Meſſias,</hi> but he beingeth no proofes for this, but only quoteth <hi>cap.</hi> 7. 11. 26. 27. which we haue already ſhewed to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he ſuppoſeth, that <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 25. 26. 27. is to be vnderſtood of <hi>Antiochus his warres againſt the Iewes,</hi> which is his common fault of <hi>petitio principij,</hi> and againſt the conſent of all good expoſitours, and the text it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he obiecteth that of the <hi>Romans: After they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.</note> 
                     <hi>had obtayned the dominion of Iewry, there were more then ten that ruled ouer the Holy Land.</hi> But what is this to the purpoſe, ſince that theſe ten horns ſignyfie 10. Kings, which ſhall raign togeather, as appeareth plainly by <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. which <hi>M. Downam</hi> obiecteth to himſelfe, and only anſwereth, that theſe of <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. are not the ſame, but other 10. <hi>which tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized ouer the Kingdome of the Iewes ſucceſſiuely, as they are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly</hi>

                     <hi>deſcribed cap.</hi> 11. but how falſe this is, hath already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, as likewiſe that which he addeth, that he whom the Papiſts take to be Antichriſt, in <hi>Daniel</hi> is one of the 10. hornes, it being manyfeſt that both <hi>Daniel,</hi> &amp; <hi>S.</hi> Io. deſcribe 10. beſides him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he ſaith, that all that <hi>Dan.</hi> ſaith of the 10. horne (ſo he calleth the 11.) <hi>do fuly and wholy agree to Antiochus Epiphanes, but not to the</hi> 10. <hi>Prince of the Romans.</hi> But we ſhall ſee a litle after, how well <hi>M. Downam</hi> can apply the pulling vp of 3. hornes to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> which that little horne <hi>cap.</hi> 7. is ſaid to do, and I belieue we ſhall find him as far to ſeeke, as he that would goe about to ſhew the ſame of the 10. Prince of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which no wiſe man will do, and <hi>M. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> knoweth well inough that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> neuer imagined any ſuch matter.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>M. Downam</hi> argueth from his <hi>conference of that, which is written of the little horne, chapter</hi> 7. <hi>with thoſe thinges which are more plainely recorded of</hi> Antiochus, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>&amp;c. and chap.</hi> 11. 21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what meruaile is there, if the 7. and 11. <hi>Chapters</hi> agree, ſince they are both to be vnderſtood of Antichriſt, as hath bene proued, and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:15294:174"/> likewiſe <hi>Antiochus</hi> was a figure of Antichriſt, and therfore no meruade, though that which is laid of him <hi>cap.</hi> 8. be very like to thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <p>11. Now at length <hi>M. Downam</hi> commeth to <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>But this opinion in my iudgment cannot be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIIII"/> for firſt it is repugnant to <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <q>But this argument of <hi>Luther</hi> hath three faultes.

                     </gap>, <hi>Inuerecundus facie:</hi> ſo doth <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <q>Finally the ſame is gathered out of the like wordes <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3. <hi>the houſe of Iſrael hath a worne forehead, and an hard hart:</hi>

                     </gap>s <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſecond fault of <hi>Luthers</hi> argument is, becauſe it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> cannot be rightly gathered out of this ſentence, that the Pope is Antichriſt (whatſoeuer it ſignifieth) for though it were manifeſt, that Antichriſt ſhalbe potent in outward pompes, and cerimonyes; yet it could not forthwith be gathered, that whoſoeuer is mighty in outward pompes and cerimonyes, is Antichriſt, for as the <hi>Logicians</hi> teach, nothing is gathered out of particuler affirmatiues: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo <hi>Moyſes</hi> was Antichriſt, who inſtituted ſo many
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:15294:183"/> Cerimonyes in <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> that they can ſearſly be numbred. And when in the ſame place it is ſaid of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> and in his figure of Antichriſt, that he ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Aenigma's</hi> or darke ſpeaches, if <hi>Luthers</hi> argument were good, it would follow, that all they who can ſolue <hi>Aenigma's,</hi> were Antichriſts, which certainely is falſe and ridiculous.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The third fault is, that he attributeth to the Pope the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Inſtitution of all Orders, and Eccleſiaſticall Cerimonies, whereas notwithſtanding it is manifeſt, that many of them were not inſtituted by the Pope, but by other holy Fathers; for the Greeke Church euer had and hath ſtill Monaſteries, rites, obſeruations, cerimonies which they receaued from <hi>S. Baſil, S. Paconius,</hi> and other Greeke Fathers, and not from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> See <hi>Caſſianus</hi> his booke <hi>de Inſtitutis renuntiantium,</hi> and <hi>S. Baſilij Conſtitutiones.</hi> In the Weſt alſo, the Orders of <hi>S. Benedict, S. Romualdus, S. Bruno, S. Dominick,</hi> and <hi>S. Francis</hi> were indeed approued by the Pope, but inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and inſtituted by thoſe holy men, whome the holy Ghoſt inſtructed. So that if theſe orders belong to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts face, rather thoſe holy Fathers, are to be called An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts, then the Pope.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Adde laſtly, that the words of <hi>Daniel</hi> agree more fitly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> to no man (excepting the true Antichriſt, who is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed in his tyme) then to <hi>Luther;</hi> for he aboue all others had an impudent face; for being a Prieſt, and a Monke, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryedopenly a Nunne, of which there can be no example giuen in all Antiquity. Likewiſe he wrote lyes without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny number, which are noted and publiſhed in wryting by many. <hi>Ioannes Cochlaeus in act.

For we read (to omit other things which are ſufficiently diſputed in the former booke) that it was ſaid to <hi>S. Peter</hi> by Chriſt <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. <hi>Feed my sheep,</hi> and we thinke, that there can be no doubt, that the ſheep are to be ruled, and iudged by the Sheepheard, and not the Sheephard by the ſheep. We alſo read <hi>Luc.</hi> 12. that it was ſaid to the ſame <hi>Peter: VVho thinkeſt thou is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and prudent Diſpenſer, whom the Lord appointeth ouer his family?</hi> In which place we ſee a certain Steward put ouer the whole family of Chriſt, certainly to gouerne it, and not to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by it.</q>

               </sp>
               <p>
                  <q>And leaſt perhaps ſome ſhould obiect, what if he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> were a naughty Steward, by whom ſhall he be iudged, if he be aboue all, and ſubiect to none? Therfore our Lord addeth forth with: <hi>And if that ſeruant shall ſay in his hart, my Lord delayeth to come, and shall begin to ſtrike the Men and Maid-ſeruants, and to eate and drinke, and be drunke; the Lord of that ſeruant will come in the day which he hopeth not, and in the houre he knoweth not, and will deuide him, and put his part with Infidels.</hi> Do you heare who is the Iudge of the euill Steward whome our Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ouer his Family? For Chriſt ſaith not, that he ſhalbe iudged by a Councell, but <hi>the Lord will come in the day, which he hopeth not,</hi> and that which followeth. Wherfore our Lord reſerueth to himſelfe the iudgment of that Seruant, whom he hath appointed ouer all his Family, and therfore the Pope taketh not away their authority from the iudgment of the Councells, and the whole Church, when he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not himſelfe to be iudged by it, for that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be taken away which was neuer giuen. But neuer did the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells rightly congregated euer take that to themſelues, that excepting the caſe of Hereſy, they would giue ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope.

<pb n="391" facs="tcp:15294:198"/> the hereſie of the <hi>Ebionits,</hi> which was rayſed in the time of the Apoſtles; by the ſecond, he vnderſtandeth the hereſie of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> which followed; by the third, the hereſie of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſatens,</hi> and <hi>Arians,</hi> which was after; by the fourth, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of <hi>Pelagius</hi> which was latter then they all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now, if by the fifth be vnderſtood the perſecution <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> of the Roman Antichriſt, which as they alſo confeſſe, is the laſt perſecution; what ſhall we vnderſtand by the ſixt trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet? <hi>Chytraeus</hi> anſwereth, that by the ſixt trumpet is ſignifyed the perſecution of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the Turkes. But this is not well ſaid, both becauſe the Mahometans are not heretikes, but Pagans; and alſo, becauſe the perſecution of Mahomet ſhall not follow, but go before Antichriſts perſecution as we thinke, or they are both togeather, as <hi>Chytraeus</hi> ſaith. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chytraeus</hi> is compelled to confound the fift trumpet with the ſixt, wheras he referred the reſt plainly inough to diuers tymes: wherfore the Catholikes vnderſtand better by the ſixt trumpet, the perſecution of Antichriſt, which ſhall truly be the laſt, and moſt grieuous, and by the fift ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pernicious hereſie, which ſhall go next before the tymes of Antichriſt, which ſurely many very probably coniecture to be the hereſie of the <hi>Lutherans.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly, becauſe <hi>Chytraeus</hi> erreth moſt groſly, when he teacheth, that <hi>S. Gregory</hi> is the falling ſtarre; for <hi>S. Gregory,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> if any credit may be giuen to hyſtories, fell not from heauen to earth, but aſcended from earth to heauen; for of a Pretor he became a Monke, and of a Monke a Biſhop: neyther did he euer returne from being a Biſhop to his Pretorſhip, nor from being a Monke to the world. As alſo <hi>S. Baſil, S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nazianzen, S. Chryſoſtome</hi> Grecians; <hi>S. Martin, S. Paulinus,</hi> and <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> Latines of ſecular, became Monkes, and of Monkes Biſhops, neither did euer any ſay, that they did therfore fall from heauen to earth. Beſides, <hi>S. Gregory</hi> was ſecond to none in continency, ſobriety, and loue of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things; and in humility, he in a manner excelled all: and yet <hi>Chytraeus</hi> dareth affirme, that he fell from heauen, that is, from an heauenly life to earth, that is, to an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and delicate life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Finally, <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe <hi>in ſupput. temp.</hi> ſaith, that <hi>S.</hi>

                     <hi>Gregory</hi> was an holy Biſhop: and <hi>Theodorus Bibliander tab.</hi> 10. <hi>Chronol.</hi> following <hi>Luther,</hi> praiſeth <hi>S. Gregory</hi> exceedingly, and ſaith, that it may be knowne by his bookes, how much be profited in piety and learning. Which doubtles is moſt true, for his writinges breath out a wonderfull holynes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Neither is that leſſe vaine, which <hi>Chytraus</hi> addeth of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> the ſmoke of the pitte, which he interpreteth the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of doctrine, brought in by <hi>S. Gregory</hi> and his Succeſſors into the Church. For <hi>S. Gregory</hi> innouated nothing, which belonged to doctrine, but concerning rites and diſcipline, he corrected many thinges, which had crept in by abuſe, many thinges he reſtored which by negligence of tymes were forgotten, he inſtituted a new very few thinges, and thoſe with mature counſaile, as may be knowne both by the 4. bookes of his life, written by <hi>Ioannes Diaconus,</hi> as alſo by his 63. <hi>epiſt. lib.</hi> 7. where he giueth accompt of the rites which he renewed or ordeyned. But this will be moſt plaine, if we runne ouer the antitheſis or oppoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the doctrine of the Ghoſpell, and the Pope, which <hi>Chytraeus</hi> propoſeth, and to which he often afterward remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his Readers.</q>

Iohn</hi> ſaith of the Locuſts do moſt aptly agree to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and the other heretikes of this tyme. For firſt the Locuſts are wont alway to come in great multitude, and to go in flocks <hi>Prou.</hi> 30. the Locuſt hath no King, and they all go out by their ſwarmes: ſo the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> properly haue not one Head, becauſe they deny, that there ought to be one Head of the whole Church. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in a very ſhort tyme they haue increaſed to a huge multitude; neither is it any meruaile, for they haue opened the gate to all vicious men: the gluttons run to them becauſe the Lutherans haue no certaine faſts: the inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, becauſe among them all vowes of continency are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked, and Monks, Prieſts, &amp; Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes are permitted to marry. Likewiſe all Apoſtataes, becauſe among them all Cloyſters are opened, and conuerted into Pallaces; couetous, and ambitious Princes, becauſe both Eccleſiaſticall goods and perſons, are ſubiected to their power; the idle, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of good workes, becauſe among them, only Faith is ſufficient, good workes are not neceſſary. Finally, all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and wicked people, becauſe all neceſſity of confeſſing their ſinnes, and giuing account to their owne Paſtour, which is wont to be a very great bridle to ſinners, is taken away among them. Hence therfore are the Locuſts ſo mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed.</q>

                     <p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LII"/> for they are ſaid to haue a mans face, yea a womans, the taile of ſcorpions, the body of Locuſts. Likewiſe they weare vpon their heads a crowne, as it were of gould; they haue the teeth of Lions, and their breſt armed with an iron
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:15294:207"/> plate. Finally, they ſeemed to be as horſes prepared to the warre: and the ſound of their winges was heard, as the noyſe of chariots running to warre, and they had for King ouer them an Angell or the bottomeleſſe pytte; who is called an Exterminatour. Their ſmoth face ſignifieth the beginning of their preaching, which alway beginneth from the Ghoſpell, for they promiſe to ſay nothing, but the moſt pure word of God, ſo they moſt eaſily allure the ſimple. The ſcorpions taile ſignifieth the poyſoned and deadly euent, for after they haue propoſed the word of God, they depraue it with their peruerſe interpretation, and in that ſort as it were writhing their taile, they ſtrike in their ſting, and infuſe their deadly poyſon. The Locuſts body which is in a manner nothing but belly (for the locuſt hath a great belly and therefore it can neither go nor fly well, but skippeth a little vp, and preſently falleth downe to the ground againe) ſignifieth that the heretikes of this tyme are men addicted to their bellies, enemies of faſting and continency, and therefore they can neither go by the way of the commandements, nor fly to the contemplation of heauenly thinges.</q>

                     <hi>as in show, any part of that office.

                  <q>If I be not decaued, all this diſcourſe may be reduced to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> this ſhort ſyllogiſme. Since this is the difference betwixt a Biſhop and a King, that a King is a name of power and gouernment, to which the office of gouerning the people is annexed: but a Biſhop is a name of the office only of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the word of God, and the Sacraments. Certainely if neither King nor the Biſhop preforme their office, the King ſhall retaine his name and dignity, and the Biſhop ſhall looſe his. But the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not performe his office, ſo much as in ſhew, ſince that he neither mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth the word of God, nor the Sacraments to the people: wherefore the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath loſt his name, and dignity and conſequently cannot be called a Biſhop.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Fourthly <hi>Martin,</hi> and all the reſt ſay, that this <hi>Iohn</hi> was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> deliuered in a ſolemne and publike Proceſſion. But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is no probability, that a woman gone with child ſo many moneths, would then chiefly goe in Proceſſion, when ſhe was in moſt danger to be diſcouered.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly this is proued out of the <hi>epiſt.</hi> of <hi>Leo</hi> 9. a moſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/> graue pope, to <hi>Michael</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople cap.</hi> 23. where Pope <hi>Leo</hi> writeth, that it is a conſtant fame, that many Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuches had ſitten in the Patriarchate of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> &amp; that among them there had crept in, and bene Patriarch a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; which certainly <hi>Leo</hi> would neuer haue obiected to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> if any ſuch thing had happened a little before to the Roman Sea: yea perhaps from hence aroſe this fable of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Woman: for wheras there was a rumour, that a certaine woman had bene Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and after by little and little, the name of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> being omitted, there remayned the fame and opinion of a woman Biſhop, and Vniuerſall Biſhop; ſome began in hatred of the Roman Church to ſay, that that woman had bene Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And it is very like, that this fame aroſe about the tyme of <hi>Martin</hi> himſelfe. Certainly <hi>Martinus Polonus,</hi> who firſt wrote it, bringeth no Author, but only ſaid: <hi>It is reported:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he only had it by an vncertaine rumour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Neither ought it to ſeeme ſtrange, if ſome feigned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> this fable in hatred of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ground of a woman being Biſhop ſuppoſed, and there being ſo many contentions at that tyme betwixt thoſe which fauoured the Emperours, and others which fauoured the Popes; for now alſo we ſee, that the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> do feigne more incredible things; for wheras <hi>Martin</hi> only wrote, that this was an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish woman of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and added nothing of the Parents &amp; proper name of the woman, and other things; the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgians</hi>
                     <pb n="419" facs="tcp:15294:212"/> haue added, that the Father of this woman was an Engliſh Prieſt, and that ſhe in the beginning was called <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> and that ſhe was brought vp in the habite of a man, in the Monaſtery of <hi>Fulda,</hi> and that ſhe wrote bookes of witchcraft; which are all meere fancies inuented without witneſſe or reaſon. Adde, that this <hi>Martinue Polonus</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue bene a moſt ſimple man, for he writeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other fables, as though they were moſt authenticall hyſtories.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now, that which they obiect of the hollow ſeate, of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/> the womans Statua, and the going out of the way, is eaſily ſolued; for as is manifeſt, out of the firſt booke of ſacred Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonyes <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. there were three ſeates of ſtone in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi> Church, in which the new Pope did ſit at the tyme of his Coronation. The firſt ſeate was before the entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple, which was vile and abiect, to which ſeate, the new Pope was firſt brought, and did ſit vpon it for a little ſpace, that it might be ſignified by that cerimony, that he aſcended from a moſt low place, to the higheſt place that is, for lifting him from thence, they ſung that 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 2. <hi>Suſcitat de puluere egenum, &amp; de ſtercore erigit pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>perem; vt ſedeat cum Principibus, &amp; ſolium gloria teneat:</hi> and this is the cauſe, why that ſeate is called <hi>Stercoraria.</hi> Another ſeate was of Porphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Pallace it ſelfe, and there he ſate the ſecond tyme, in token of Poſſeſſion: and ſitting there he receaued the Keyes of the Church of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Pallace. The third ſeat was like the ſecond, and not farre from it, and after ſitting a little in it, he deliuered the ſame keyes to him, of whome he had receaued them before. Perhaps, that by that cerimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony he might be admoniſhed of death, by which ere long he was to reſigne that power to another. Of any ſeate to diſcouer the ſexe, there is no mention any where.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And that Statua of the woman with child, without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/> doubt was not of Pope <hi>Iohn:</hi> for if our Aduerſaries ſay, that the ancient Hiſtoriographers would not make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this woman in their bookes, in the Popes fauour: how is it probable, that the Popes themſelues would haue memory of it extant in a Statua? Beſides, if it were the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua of this <hi>Iohn,</hi> it ſhould haue repreſented a Woman with an
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:15294:213"/> infant newly borne, but that Image did neither repreſent a woman, nor did carry an infant in her armes, but did expreſſe a good big boy, and many yeares old, as a ſeruant going before. Wherefore ſome do coniecture, that it was a Status of ſome heathen Prieſt prepared to Sacrifice, before whom his Miniſter went.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Finally it is not in deſteſtation of that cryme, why <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/> the Popes go not the ſhorter way to the <hi>Lateran,</hi> but becauſe the way is narrow and ſteepy, and therefore incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the Popes trayne, or compaine, which alwayes vſeth to be very great. Adde, that as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> witneſſeth, there want not Popes, who haue oftner then once gone that very way.</q>
